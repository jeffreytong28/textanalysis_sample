Climate adaptation planning for cultural heritages in coastal tourism destinations: A multi-objective optimization approach,"Substantial climate change impacts threaten the persistence of cultural resources globally. The need exists for conceptualizing decision support tools that focus on quantifying and optimizing the managerial priorities to leverage historic preservation and adaptation actions that enhance the continuity of heritage values and sites. Informed by the Structured Decision Making (SDM) approach, this study advances the singular objective Optimal Preservation (OptiPres) Model, a decision support tool for climate adaptation planning of historic buildings by considering three tourism management objectives: (a) maximize accumulated resource value, (b) maximize cost-efficiency, and (c) minimize vulnerability. These objectives are tested under different budget scenarios using a 30-year planning horizon with a subset of buildings located in two historic districts of Cape Lookout National Seashore (CALO), United States. The multi-objective approach demonstrates the OptiPres Model is transformative, transparent, and transferable for providing cultural resource decision support and enhancing the sustainability of cultural heritage globally. © 2021 The Authors"
An urban energy balance-guided machine learning approach for synthetic nocturnal surface Urban Heat Island prediction: A heatwave event in Naples,"Southern European functional urban areas (FUAs) are increasingly subject to heatwave (HW) events, calling for anticipated climate adaptation measures. In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough understanding of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corresponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning approach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps – built-up infrastructures uptake heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land surfaces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important explanatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In future research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Multi-hazard susceptibility and exposure assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalaya,"Mountainous regions are highly hazardous, and these hazards often lead to loss of human life. The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH. © 2021 The Authors"
One Versus All: Best Practices in Combining Multi-hazard Damage Imagery Training Datasets for Damage Detection for a Deep Learning Neural Network,"Accurate and timely damage assessment is important after any natural disaster event. Accurate damage assessments enhance the efficient distribution of resources. Building damage levels are an important outcome of damage assessment, especially in urban areas. Although at present most building damage assessments are collected manually from post-disaster satellite images or aerial photographs, efforts are now underway to automate the process. Some of these efforts use deep learning algorithms to first identify buildings and then to classify them into damage levels. One of these efforts initiated in 2019, through the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and with Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Recovery (HADR) organizations, created a multi-hazard training dataset using high-resolution satellite imagery from pre- and post-event imagery (xBD). Across 19 natural disaster events including tornados, wildfire, earthquake, hurricanes, volcanos, flood, and tsunami, buildings were identified and classified into four classes: no damage, minor damage, major damage, and destroyed. Participants in the challenge were expected to use deep learning algorithms to perform the classification. They were also provided with a base classification algorithm, in which participants were encouraged to improve. The base algorithm contained RESNET50 trained on ImageNet database and three additional convolution and max pooling layers. This project analyzes the quality of the training dataset, discusses the pros and cons of combining training dataset across multiple natural disaster events, and provides recommendations on using the provided training dataset to optimize classification accuracy. Specifically, we will provide recommendations on creating class balance in the training dataset, in which damage labels are the most identifiable. We will also provide an assessment on which natural disasters lead to damage that is most identifiable using satellite imagery in which natural disasters lead to less accurate damage assessments. We will also examine pooling training data across natural disasters to achieve more accurate classifications. © 2022, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc."
Disaster City Digital Twin: A vision for integrating artificial and human intelligence for disaster management,"This paper presents a vision for a Disaster City Digital Twin paradigm that can: (i) enable interdisciplinary convergence in the field of crisis informatics and information and communication technology (ICT) in disaster management; (ii) integrate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and approaches to improve situation assessment, decision making, and coordination among various stakeholders; and (iii) enable increased visibility into network dynamics of complex disaster management and humanitarian actions. The number of humanitarian relief actions is growing due to the increased frequency of natural and man-made crises. Various streams of research across different disciplines have focused on ICT and AI solutions for enhancing disaster management processes. However, most of the existing research is fragmented without a common vision towards a converging paradigm. Recognizing this, this paper presents the Disaster City Digital Twin as a unifying paradigm. The four main components of the proposed Digital Twin paradigm include: multi-data sensing for data collection, data integration and analytics, multi-actor game-theoretic decision making, and dynamic network analysis. For each component, the current state of the art related to AI methods and approaches are examined and gaps are identified.

Flood susceptibility modelling using advanced ensemble machine learning models,"Floods are one of nature's most destructive disasters because of the immense damage to land, buildings, and human fatalities. It is difficult to forecast the areas that are vulnerable to flash flooding due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state-of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of these models includes twelve flood influencing factors with 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models. The approach and solution-oriented outcomes outlined in this paper will assist state and local authorities as well as policy makers in reducing flood-related threats and will also assist in the implementation of effective mitigation strategies to mitigate future damage.

Emergent vulnerability to climate-driven disturbances in European forests,"Forest disturbance regimes are expected to intensify as Earth’s climate changes. Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979–2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40%) and fires (34%) compared to insect outbreaks (26%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes. © 2021, The Author(s)."
Development and validation of climatic hazard indicators for roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) crop in dryland agriculture,"Two of the major challenges in achieving food security in the future are: (1) the increase in demand for food due to constant high population growth and (2) the increase in adverse climatic conditions, due to global climate change, that will affect crops. Currently, no universal indicators are available to identify the effect of extreme climate events on specific crops of nutritional and commercial importance, as they need to be developed according to each species’ physiology. Likewise, it is necessary to develop production qualifiers that allow us to identify whether the agricultural year presents high or low climatic hazards for a specific crop. In this study of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) grown in dryland agricultural conditions in the Bajo Balsas, Michoacán, Mexico, we aimed to 1) generate and validate climatic hazard indicators and 2) propose an equation to calculate annual climatic hazards, considering the different phenological crop stages. We present both phenological and climatic information that is used for the development of 13 agroclimatic hazard indicators that have been proposed for the roselle crop in La Huacana a municipality in Michoacán. Artificial intelligence and neural networks were used for both weight variable identification in the equation and to validate the annual classification, which is derived from the proposed equation. Our proposed equation for the quick assessment of agroclimatic hazards for the roselle crop is a new tool that helps in planning and decision-making in the face of the growing presence of extreme climate events. © 2020 The Authors"
Study of Climate Change Detection in North East Africa using Machine learning and Satellite Data,"The study of climate change has become an important topic, because of its negative impact on human life. The North-East African part lacks the studies for climate change detection, despite it being one of the most affected parts worldwide. The relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is an important factor to understand. To investigate this linkage, we used machine-learning models based on essential climate variables to investigate the relationship between the GHGs and the rhythm of climate variable change. The research investigates how machine learning techniques can be applied to climatic data to build an ML model that able to predict the state of climate variables for the short and long term. By selecting a candidate model, will help in climate adaptation and mitigation, also determine at what level GHGs should be kept and their corresponding concentrations in order to avoid climate events and crises. The used models are long short-term memory, autoencoders, and convolutional neural network. Alternatively, the data set has been selected from UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) and Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3Ss). We compared the performance of these techniques and the best candidate was the Head CNN; based on performance metrics such as Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE): 5.378, 2.395, and 15.923, and R Coefficient: 0.607, 0.806, and 0.539 for the variables temperature, CO2, and CH4 respectively. We were able to link the greenhouse gas emission to essential climate variables with high accuracy based on the reading of this geographic area. Author"
AI Alignment of Disaster Resilience Management Support Systems,"This paper presents an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) prospective studies to determine the most suitable AI technologies for implementation in Disaster Resilience Management Support Systems (DRMSSs). The pivotal role in our approach is played by the security needs analysis in the context of most common natural disasters and their co-occurrence with other threats. The AI trends and scenarios to align with are derived according to foresight principles. We apply expert knowledge elicitation and fusion techniques as well as a control model of technology dynamics. The pre-assessments of security needs and technological evolution prospects are combined to rank and select the most prospective AI methods and tools. Long-term ex-ante impact assessment of future disaster resilience improvements resulting from different DRMSS implementations, allows for the identification of the most suitable AI deployment variant. The target market of the DRMSSs under study includes industrial corporations and urban critical infrastructures, to become part of their Industry 4.0 ecosystems. The models of protected area and its environment are continually updated with visual monitoring and other sensors embedded in the Industrial Internet-of-Things infrastructure. The software architecture of DRMSS focuses on model-based decision support that applies fuzzy-stochastic uncertainty and multicriteria optimization. The business processes behind the AI alignment follow these goals. In the conclusion, we will show that DRMSS allows stakeholders to reach social, technological, and economic objectives simultaneously. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
A forecasting and prediction methodology for improving the blue economy resilience to climate change in the romanian lower danube euroregion,"European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by un-locking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geo-graphic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta–Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost‐efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water‐dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the ʺDanube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already‐existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost‐demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Predicting susceptibility to landslides under climate change impacts in metropolitan areas of South Korea using machine learning,"Landslides cause considerable damage to life and property worldwide. In order to prevent and respond to landslides, it is necessary to identify vulnerable areas. This study identified areas that are likely to be damaged by landslides and aimed to predict future landslides. We compared and analyzed areas using machine learning (ML) algorithms, and conducted susceptibility mapping and landslide prediction using an algorithm that produced excellent results. For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time. In addition, many urban areas are distributed around forest areas that have high landslide vulnerabilities, which provide important perspectives for urban and environmental planning. © 2021 The Author(s).

Resilient Operation of Distribution Grids Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop an intelligent resilience controller (IRC) that devises fast real-time operation decisions to strategically dispatch distributed generation and energy storage units for restoring power to customers after sudden outages. The proposed IRC learns the failure development pattern of uncertain high impact events and is able to explore a large action space in the partially observable state space of distribution grids under widespread outages. A spatio-temporal hurricane impact analysis model is presented as an example of uncertain high impact events, and its parameters are used in training the IRC model, and prepare it for similar events. In the proposed model, the distribution grid operation under uncertainty is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and actions taken by the operator are rewarded based on operation costs. Since the number of distributed energy resources can be significant, the scalability issue of the method is addressed by reformulating the problem as a sequential MDP. The proposed model is implemented on a test distribution grid undergoing a hurricane, and its performance is compared with common operation strategies, indicating the superiority of the proposed model in terms of reduced outage cost and close to zero running time. Further analysis shows the robustness of the proposed model to deviations from the training set. IEEE"
Augmented Convolutional LSTMs for Generation of High-Resolution Climate Change Projections,"Projection of changes in extreme indices of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are critical to assess the potential impacts of climate change on human-made and natural systems, including critical infrastructures and ecosystems. While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling. The current study performs daily downscaling of precipitation variable from an ESM output at 1.15 degrees (115 km) to 1/4 degrees (25 km) over one of the most climatically diversified countries, India. We showcase significant improvement gain against two popular state-of-the-art baselines with a better ability to predict statistics of extreme events. To facilitate reproducible research, we make available all the codes, processed datasets, and trained models in the public domain. © 2013 IEEE."
Modeling Urban Futures: Data-Driven Scenarios of Climate Change and Vulnerability in Cities,"Cities are complex systems where social, ecological, and technological processes are deeply coupled. This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata model uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical flood hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."
A Distributed Artificial Intelligence Framework to Evolve Infrastructure Resilience in Telecommunications Sector,"Severe natural threats have been increased by climate changes and this originates various high-level threats. This paper discusses the concept of resilience in the context of these problems for telecommunications sector. One of the recent examples that led to a wide power instability was the power cut off. Many telecommunications operators forced actions to limit the spread of natural risks. The paper’s main focus is on two main purposes, the first one is the to propose a mechanism for enhancing resilience in telecom infrastructure, while the second purpose is to quantify the financial value to achieve this resilience. From this point, early definitions of power systems resilience were provided. Then, we examine the main effects of natural disasters on the resilience of the infrastructure in telecommunication sectors, especially the ones related to energy. Eventually, a decentralized plan of action is proposed for a Resilient Management System (RMS) with the aid of demand response resources and distributed storage. The high-precision model which we pro-pose provides telecom operators, regulatory authorities and IT sectors with a clear image for taking defensive measures and making strategic decisions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Assessment of Urban Infrastructures Exposed to Flood Using Susceptibility Map and Google Earth Engine,"Acute hydrological natural hazards, such as floods, not only affect the lives and properties of people but also cause severe damage to the critical infrastructures, which needs to be function even in substandard situations. Therefore, it is significant to predict the flood-prone areas for understanding how critical infrastructures are exposed to massive flooding. For this aim, flood-prone areas and their susceptibility are mapped using machine learning techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT) and generalized linear model (GLM) with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The BRT model achieved the highest precision (AUC = 81.10%) in comparison to GLM (AUC = 78.30%) and was utilized for evaluating the flood risk on critical infrastructures. In addition, the flood risk in four large and famous watersheds, namely Zohre, Dorodzan, Tashk-Bakhtegan, and Qareagaj located in Fars Province was analyzed, among which Zohre had the highest risk to flooding. The assessment of flood risk on critical infrastructures, such as hospitals, pharmacies, banks, fire stations, automated teller machines, fuel stations, speed cameras, and mosques located in Shiraz County (capital of Fars Province) disclosed that these structures had high and very high flood hazard. The evaluation of flood risk on schools situated in nine most populated cities of Fars Province was also carried out, which revealed that Shiraz had the maximum percentage (92.98%) and Marvdasht had the least percentage (60.75%) of schools that fall under very high risk. This article aids the decision makers in better planning for flood resilience and risk management. © 2008-2012 IEEE."
Disaster resilience in Pakistan: A comprehensive multi-dimensional spatial profiling,"Building disaster-resilient communities require operative resilience frameworks enabling factual decision-making and resource allocation at national and sub-national scales. While Pakistan is frequently hit by several natural hazards (i.e., floods, droughts, earthquakes, and extreme heatwaves) resulting in devastating impacts, no national-level higher-resolution disaster resilience information is available to provide references for informed planning. Hence, this study provides a, first of its kind, multi-level comprehensive disaster resilience evaluation in Pakistan. To do so, data on a customized list of indicators within three key resilience sub-components (i.e., economic, institutional, and social) are acquired to compute a resilience index. Frequency distribution and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methods are employed to analyse the differences between different resilience indices and a cross-regional assessment is carried out at the sub-national level. Subsequently, an extensive spatial assessment is performed using geo-information models (i.e., Global Moran's I, Local Indicators of Spatial Association, and machine learning-based multivariate clustering) to explore the global and local geographies of the resilience. Based on ANOVA, significant differences between the resilience sub-components are found (95% confidence). The geographical distribution of resilience scores ascertains a large spatial heterogeneity across the study area with the least resilient regions belonging to Sindh and Balochistan provinces (95% confidence). As shown by the machine learning-based multivariate clustering, the least resilient regions particularly lack in economic and institutional aspects of disaster resilience. The findings provide important references to ensure resilience management-related cross-regional equity and justice. The rigorous analyses regarding the geographies of disaster resilience in Pakistan are important to support the country's disaster risk reduction efforts. While the results are useful for practitioners, decision-makers, and professionals in the risk management field, the study has important policy-relevant implications in the context of disaster risk mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
Toward the probabilistic forecasting of cyclone-induced marine flooding by overtopping at Reunion Island aided by a time-varying random-forest classification approach,"In 2017, Irma and Maria highlighted the vulnerability of small islands to cyclonic events and the necessity of advancing the forecast techniques for cyclone-induced marine flooding. In this context, this paper presents a generic approach to deriving time-varying inundation forecasts from ensemble track and intensity forecasts applied to the case of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The challenge for volcanic islands is to account for the full complexity of wave overtopping processes while also ensuring a robustness and timeliness that are compatible with emergency requirements. The challenge is addressed by following a hybrid approach relying on the combination of process-based models with a statistical model (herein, a random-forest classifier) trained with a precalculated database. The latter enables one to translate any time series of coastal marine conditions into the time-varying probability of inundation for different sectors. The application detailed for the case of Cyclone Dumile at Sainte-Suzanne city shows that the proposed approach enables quick discrimination, in both space and time, thereby identifying safe and exposed areas and demonstrating that probabilistic forecasting of marine flooding by overtopping is feasible. The whole method can be easily adapted to other territories and scales provided that validated process-based models are available. Beyond early warning applications, the developed database and statistical models may also be used for informing risk prevention and adaptation strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."
Improved Transferability of Data-Driven Damage Models Through Sample Selection Bias Correction,"Damage models for natural hazards are used for decision making on reducing and transferring risk. The damage estimates from these models depend on many variables and their complex sometimes nonlinear relationships with the damage. In recent years, data-driven modeling techniques have been used to capture those relationships. The available data to build such models are often limited. Therefore, in practice it is usually necessary to transfer models to a different context. In this article, we show that this implies the samples used to build the model are often not fully representative for the situation where they need to be applied on, which leads to a “sample selection bias.” In this article, we enhance data-driven damage models by applying methods, not previously applied to damage modeling, to correct for this bias before the machine learning (ML) models are trained. We demonstrate this with case studies on flooding in Europe, and typhoon wind damage in the Philippines. Two sample selection bias correction methods from the ML literature are applied and one of these methods is also adjusted to our problem. These three methods are combined with stochastic generation of synthetic damage data. We demonstrate that for both case studies, the sample selection bias correction techniques reduce model errors, especially for the mean bias error this reduction can be larger than 30%. The novel combination with stochastic data generation seems to enhance these techniques. This shows that sample selection bias correction methods are beneficial for damage model transfer. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis"
"Fusion-based framework for meteorological drought modeling using remotely sensed datasets under climate change scenarios: Resilience, vulnerability, and frequency analysis","Severe drought events in recent decades and their catastrophic effects have called for drought prediction and monitoring needed for developing drought readiness plans and mitigation measures. This study used a fusion-based framework for meteorological drought modeling for the historical (1983–2016) and future (2020–2050) periods using remotely sensed datasets versus ground-based observations and climate change scenarios. To this aim, high-resolution remotely sensed precipitation datasets, including PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS (multi-source products), ERA5 (reanalysis datasets), and GPCC (gauge-interpolated datasets), were employed to estimate non-parametric SPI (nSPI) as a meteorological drought index against local observations. For more accurate drought evaluation, all stations were classified into different clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm based on ground-based nSPI. Then, four Individual Artificial Intelligence (IAI) models, including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), were developed for drought modeling within each cluster. Finally, two advanced fusion-based methods, including Multi-Model Super Ensemble (MMSE) as a linear weighted model and a nonlinear model called machine learning Random Forest (RF), combined results by IAI models using different remotely sensed datasets. The proposed framework was implemented to simulate each remotely sensed precipitation data for the future based on CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for drought projection. The efficiency of IAI and fusion models was evaluated using statistical error metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed methodology was employed in the Gavkhooni basin of Iran, and results showed that the RF model with the lowest estimation error (RMSE of 0.391 and R2 of 0.810) had performed well compared to all other models. Finally, the resilience, vulnerability, and frequency of probability metrics indicated that the 12-month time scale of drought affected the basin more severely than other time scales. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Assessment of transportation system disruption and accessibility to critical amenities during flooding: Iowa case study,"Natural disasters, such as flooding, can cause severe social, environmental, and economic damage to a community. Transportation infrastructure plays an essential role in flood response and recovery efforts. However, flooding may disturb road functionality and generate direct and indirect adverse impacts, including the loss of access to essential services. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of flood impacts on road network topology and accessibility to amenities for major communities in the State of Iowa using graph-theoretic methods, including single-source shortest path analyses. We assessed the disruption of transportation networks on the accessibility to critical amenities (e.g., hospitals) under 100 and 500-year flood scenarios. Our analysis methodology leads toward the development of an integrated real-time decision support system that will allow decision-makers to explore “what if” flood scenarios to identify vulnerable areas and population in their authority. These analyses could promote possible improvements (e.g., temporary relocation of critical services) to mitigate the consequences of road system failure during flooding. Due to varying environmental conditions at specific locations and effects on road topology under flood events, the results show differential impacts in edge and node losses as well as access to critical services. Results indicate that floods can lead to edge losses of up to 18%, and not only large cities but also some small cities can experience significant vulnerability to flooding. Some new or reconstructed bridges have failed to operate during analyzed flood events. During the 100 and 500-year flood return periods, the total number of inaccessible bridges within the selected cities is 184 and 294, respectively. Our work found that the shortest path length to the closest critical amenity under baseline condition can flip to the second or higher-orders during flooding. Many critical amenities have been found at risk of flooding in the studied cities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Data-Driven Classifier for Extreme Outage Prediction Based on Bayes Decision Theory,"The growing concern over catastrophic weather events, mostly as a direct result of climate changes, has underscored the need for expanding traditional power system contingency analyses to handle the associated risks of extreme power outages. To enable power system operators to make timely decisions when facing extreme events, we explore in this paper the viability of a classifier which uses the machine learning approach based on the Bayes decision theory as a means of predicting power system component outages. However, owing to an excessively imbalanced and largely sparse power component outage datasets, the corresponding classifier learning is a challenging problem in the data mining community. In the proposed approach, we apply a resampling method to overcome the class imbalance problem. The proposed classifier provides an effective framework that not only minimizes outage prediction errors for power system components, but also considers the cost of each preventive action according to its implication in extreme events. The outcome of the proposed model can be used for introducing operation-oriented preventive measures that allow the rescheduling of generation resources for maximizing the power system resilience. The performance of the proposed classifier is examined through numerical simulations by utilizing the confusion matrix. © 1969-2012 IEEE."
Modelling multi-hazard threats to cultural heritage sites and environmental sustainability: The present and future scenarios,"Cultural heritage sites, particularly those in mountainous regions face serious threats as mountains are hazardous places and many of them are located on shifting tectonic plates and live under the threat of earthquakes and related activities. Alongside, mountains are also exposed to atmospheric interactions and rainfall plays an important role in land movement activities through seepage of rainwater in fragile structures. Moreover, gravity pushing along with land use and climate change induced changing rainfall patterns and modification of slope lead to several hazards in mountainous regions. Environmental degradation in terms of soil erosion, loss of forests, and agricultural products are common phenomena in mountainous regions due to various multi-hazard threats. Therefore, it is necessary to conserve and management of our mountain environments as it is essential to the survival of the global ecosystem. Thus, the current research article focused on multi-hazard susceptibility mapping and evaluation of its risk assessment in some of the famous cultural heritage sites in the eastern Himalayan region of Sikkim state, India. Multi-hazard susceptibility mapping was carried out using boosted regression tree (BRT), Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) and Bayesian generalized linear model (BGLM) considering twenty-two conditioning factors and seismic activity, as this region is highly susceptible to earthquakes. The future climate and land use change were estimated using four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and Dynamic Conversion of Land-Use and its Effects (Dyna-CLUE) model respectively to identify future multi-hazard susceptibility areas and vulnerable cultural heritage sites. The novelty of this study is to a combination of machine learning, RCPs derived future climate and Dyna-CLUE induced future land use change estimation for multi-hazard modelling and identification of vulnerable cultural heritage sites. The result of this study will help land use planners and archaeologists to adopt proper management strategies for protecting the cultural heritage sites and maintaining environmental sustainability for the proper management of mountain resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Machine learning reveals a significant shift in water regime types due to projected climate change,"A water regime type is a cumulative representation of seasonal runoff variability in a textual, qualitative, or quantitative form developed for a particular period. The assessment of the respective water regime type changes is of high importance for local communities and water management authorities, increasing their awareness and opening strategies for adaptation. In the presented study, we trained a machine learning model—the Random Forest classifier—to predict water regime types in northwest Russia based on monthly climatological hydrographs derived for a historical period (1979–1991). Evaluation results show the high efficiency of the trained model with an accuracy of 91.6%. Then, the Random Forest model was used to predict water regime types based on runoff projections for the end of the 21st century (2087–2099) forced by four different General Circulation Models (GCM) and three Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP). Results indicate that climate is expected to modify water regime types remarkably. There are two primary directions of projected changes. First, we detect the tendency towards less stable summer and winter flows. The second direction is towards a shift in spring flood characteristics. While spring flooding is expected to remain the dominant phase of the water regime, the flood peak is expected to shift towards earlier occurrence and lower magnitude. We identified that the projected changes in water regime types are more pronounced in more aggressive RCP scenarios. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
Large-Scale Visual Data-Driven Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Utility Poles Regarding the Vulnerability of Power Distribution Infrastructure Systems,"Inspecting and assessing existing utility poles has become increasingly important for reducing the vulnerability of power distribution infrastructure systems in disaster situations, which can enhance community resilience. Although vision-based systems have been applied to detect faults in power distribution infrastructures, little research currently exists on assessing component- and network-level failures of utility poles based on their geometric and environmental information. This paper aims to propose a new data-driven approach to support risk-informed decision-making for utility maintenance under extreme wind conditions. Large-scale open-source imagery from Google Street View is used to assess geometric properties of utility poles (i.e., leaning angle). Then the failure probability of utility poles is analyzed under varying conditions (e.g., age, leaning angle, and wind loads) in a three-dimensional virtual city model. The proposed method is tested through case studies in Texas to (1) validate an algorithm for estimating leaning angles of utility poles and (2) understand the progress of failures of leaning utility poles from a network perspective. The outcomes of the case studies demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to leverage large-scale open-source visual data to assess the vulnerability of utility pole networks that may lead to cascading failures in power distribution infrastructure systems. Based on the proposed virtual environment, the method is expected to enable practitioners to facilitate risk-informed decision-making against disaster situations, which creates an opportunity for prioritizing maintenance tasks regarding power distribution infrastructures. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."
Identifying global and local drivers of change in mangrove cover and the implications for management,"Background: Climate change and human activities continue to drive a widespread decline in global mangrove coverage, undermining their capacity to provide ecosystem benefits. While global and local scale drivers of change on mangroves are widely acknowledged, the relative importance and the exposure of mangroves to climatic, geomorphological, and direct human threats vary spatially. Understanding the role and relative importance of the multiscale and multiple threats to mangroves and how these vary spatially is fundamental for formulating a spatially adaptive approach to their management and conservation. Aim: Our study investigated the role of multiple threats on mangroves and the relative exposure. Location: Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Time period: Recent past (2002–2019 and future (2050–2060). Major taxa studied: Mangrove. Methods: Using satellite-derived indicators of mangrove condition aggregated over 19 years (2002 to 2019) and 14 proxies of climate, human activity, and geomorphology, we applied machine learning methods to determine the role and relative importance of the change drivers. Using outputs from this deductive statistical process, we applied inductive methods to map mangrove exposure spatially. Results: Model results highlight the importance of catchment erosion, human pressure, sea level, and macroclimate as the main drivers of the present-day ecological condition of mangroves in the WIO. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was more sensitive to the identified drivers than the vegetation condition index (VCI), with the relative importance of variables varying across the two vegetation indicators. Main conclusions: In anticipation of a stronger manifestation of climate change impacts, the resilience of mangroves in the WIO could be improved through adaptive management over time and space. Testing the efficacy of the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) is critical for understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem change and managing biodiversity change. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
Constructing the machine learning techniques based spatial drought vulnerability index in Karnataka state of India,"The drought induced vulnerability is owed much to rapid modernization, climate extremes, and over exploitation of natural resources. However, a natural phenomenon, the drought is amplified by anthropogenic activities that in its enormity influences water availability, agricultural productivity, ecosystem, groundwater storage. The Karnataka state of India is frequently affected by the drought that causes huge loss in agricultural sector and other allied sectors. Therefore, it is essential to measure the vulnerability status for the better management of natural resources in the state of Karnataka. No advanced models are being used yet to portray the drought vulnerability status. Different advanced machine learning models are effective in predicting various physical vulnerabilities. The aim of this study was to use sophisticated machine learning models to precisely define relative drought vulnerability. In that endeavour, it used two advanced machine-learning algorithms (MLAs), namely, Bagging and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which are still not used in this field. Twenty-six meteorological and socio-economical parameters were considered to find the most drought vulnerable areas. The predisposing parameters were classified as resilience (7 parameters), sensitivity (9 parameters), and exposure (10 parameters). The researchers have produced drought vulnerability maps for overall condition, resilience, sensitivity, and exposure. The relative drought vulnerability maps (RDVMs) clearly show that 40.87%–52.03% of areas fall under very high vulnerability, which is situated in the central and eastern parts of the state. The prediction capacity of newly built models was judged with efficiency, root mean square error (RMSE), true skill statistics (TSS), Friedman and Wilcoxon rank test, and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC). All of them showed satisfactory results - the RMSE value of 0.32 and 0.33, TSS values of 0.82 and 0.81, and AUC values of 86.50% and 84.20% as obtained by ANN and bagging models, respectively. The produced RDVMs demonstrate the urgency of policy interventions to minimize vulnerability in prioritized areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
The food equity and environmental data sovereignty (feeds) project: Protocol for a quasi-experimental study evaluating a digital platform for climate change preparedness,"Background: Despite having the tools at our disposal to enable an adequate food supply for all people, inequities in food acquisition, distribution, and most importantly, food sovereignty, worsen food insecurity. The detrimental impact of climate change on food systems and mental health is further exacerbated by a lack of food sovereignty. We urgently require innovative solutions to enable food sovereignty, minimize food insecurity, and address climate change-related mental distress (ie, solastalgia). Indigenous communities have a wealth of Traditional Knowledge for climate change adaptation and preparedness to strengthen food systems. Traditional Knowledge combined with Western methods can revolutionize ethical data collection, engagement, and knowledge mobilization. Objective: The Food Equity and Environmental Data Sovereignty (FEEDS) Project takes a participatory action, citizen science approach for early detection and warning of climate change impacts on food sovereignty, food security, and solastalgia. The aim of this project is to develop and implement a sustainable digital platform that enables real-time decision-making to mitigate climate change-related impacts on food systems and mental well-being. Methods: Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process. The FEEDS Project is being implemented in five phases: participatory project planning, digital climate change platform customization, community-led evaluation, digital platform and project refinement, and integrated knowledge translation. The project is governed by a Citizen Scientist Advisory Council comprising Elders, Traditional Knowledge Keepers, key community decision makers, youth, and FEEDS Project researchers. The Council governs all phases of the project, including coconceptualizing a climate change platform, which consists of a smartphone app and a digital decision-making dashboard. Apart from capturing environmental and health-related big data (eg, weather, permafrost degradation, fire hazards, and human movement), the custom-built app uses artificial intelligence to engage and enable citizens to report on environmental hazards, changes in biodiversity or wildlife, and related food and mental health issues in their communities. The app provides citizens with valuable information to mitigate health-related risks and relays big data in real time to a digital dashboard. Results: This project is currently in phase 1, with the subarctic Métis jurisdiction of Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan, Canada. Conclusions: The FEEDS Project facilitates Indigenous Peoples' self-determination, governance, and data sovereignty. All citizen data are anonymous and encrypted, and communities have ownership, access, control, and possession of their data. The digital dashboard system provides decision makers with real-time data, thereby increasing the capacity to self-govern. The participatory action research approach, combined with digital citizen science, advances the cocreation of knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration in the digital age. Given the urgency of climate change, leveraging technology provides communities with tools to respond to existing and emerging crises in a timely manner, as well as scientific evidence regarding the urgency of current health and environmental issues. © Jasmin Bhawra, Kelly Skinner, Duane Favel, Brenda Green, Ken Coates, Tarun Reddy Katapally."
ClimeGreAq: A software-based DSS for the climate change adaptation of Greek aquaculture,"Climate change poses increasing challenges to aquaculture, resulting in the need to develop appropriate tools to assess these challenges and support decision-making. We present ClimeGreAq, a software-based Decision Support System (DSS) co-created with stakeholders to support the adaptation of Greek aquaculture to climate change. The DSS is based on an integrated modeling approach which links a biological and an economic model in order to simulate the effects of climate drivers on Greek aquaculture in a spatially heterogeneous manner. The tool may be used by stakeholders including farmers, producer organizations, regional administrations and national authorities to support decision-making on questions ranging from selecting appropriate farming locations, to designating zones for aquaculture activities, to developing national climate adaptation plans. Along with a description of the DSS design process, its structure, and the constituent models, key results are presented relating to stakeholder involvement, the user interface, and several application examples. © 2021"
Widespread regeneration failure in forests of Greater Yellowstone under scenarios of future climate and fire,"Changing climate and disturbance regimes are increasingly challenging the resilience of forest ecosystems around the globe. A powerful indicator for the loss of resilience is regeneration failure, that is, the inability of the prevailing tree species to regenerate after disturbance. Regeneration failure can result from the interplay among disturbance changes (e.g., larger and more frequent fires), altered climate conditions (e.g., increased drought), and functional traits (e.g., method of seed dispersal). This complexity makes projections of regeneration failure challenging. Here we applied a novel simulation approach assimilating data-driven fire projections with vegetation responses from process modeling by means of deep neural networks. We (i) quantified the future probability of regeneration failure; (ii) identified spatial hotspots of regeneration failure; and (iii) assessed how current forest types differ in their ability to regenerate under future climate and fire. We focused on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2.9 × 106 ha of forest) in the Rocky Mountains of the USA, which has experienced large wildfires in the past and is expected to undergo drastic changes in climate and fire in the future. We simulated four climate scenarios until 2100 at a fine spatial grain (100 m). Both wildfire activity and unstocked forest area increased substantially throughout the 21st century in all simulated scenarios. By 2100, between 28% and 59% of the forested area failed to regenerate, indicating considerable loss of resilience. Areas disproportionally at risk occurred where fires are not constrained by topography and in valleys aligned with predominant winds. High-elevation forest types not adapted to fire (i.e., Picea engelmannii–Abies lasiocarpa as well as non-serotinous Pinus contorta var. latifolia forests) were especially vulnerable to regeneration failure. We conclude that changing climate and fire could exceed the resilience of forests in a substantial portion of Greater Yellowstone, with profound implications for carbon, biodiversity, and recreation. © 2021 The Authors.

Irrigation and shifting planting date as climate change adaptation strategies for sorghum,"Climate change is projected to have a global impact that affect food production and security. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential impact of climate change on sorghum yield for rainfed production systems and to evaluate the potential of irrigation and shifting planting dates as adaptation options for two major sorghum production regions in Ethiopia. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Sorghum model was used to simulate the impact of climate change on sorghum yield for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and for three future periods including the 2025s (2010–2039), 2055s (2040–2069), and 2085s (2070–2099). The Agricultural Model Improvement and Inter-comparison Project (AgMIP) framework was used to select five representative GCMs for hot/dry, cool/dry, middle, hot/wet, and cool/wet climate scenarios. Two climate change adaptation practices including supplemental irrigation at two levels (deficit and full) to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates were evaluated. The CSM-CERES-Sorghum model was calibrated and evaluated using eight years of experimental data from Meisso, eastern Ethiopia. The model was then run for Kobo and Meisso under different climate change and crop management scenarios. Based on model evaluation results, the model performed well for simulating sorghum yield (R2 = 0.99), anthesis (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.3), and maturity (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 4.4). The results showed that the average temperature for Kobo and Meisso is expected to increase by up to 6 °C under RCP8.5 in 2085. For the rainfed production systems without adaptation practices, drought stress is projected to intensify during anthesis, which was reflected by projected yield reductions by up 2 t ha−1 for the two sites. Full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and, thereby, increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 t ha−1 for Kobo and 2 t ha−1 for Meisso. On average, full irrigation resulted in a 1 t ha−1 yield increase compared with deficit irrigation. Early planting dates also resulted in an increase in yield compared to the baseline planting dates, especially when combined with supplemental irrigation, although late planting was consistently disadvantageous even with supplemental irrigation. This study highlighted that the CSM-CERES-Sorghum model can be effectively used to simulate climate change effects on sorghum yield and evaluate different climate change adaptation practices. The outcomes of this study can also help to implement management decisions towards climate change adaptation for the current subsistence and fragile rainfed crop production system in Ethiopia and similar ecoregions across the globe. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Land degradation mapping in the MATOPIBA region (Brazil) using remote sensing data and decision-tree analysis,"The expansion of agricultural activities in Brazil resulted in a loss of approximately 50% of the native vegetation of the Cerrado biome, mainly to the north of the biome in a region known as MATOPIBA. Besides contributing to accelerate climate change, the removal of native vegetation is associated with increase soil degradation. In this study, we used the decision tree method to predict degradation using as indicators Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived indices over the period 1985–2018. Results showed that approximately 4677 km2 (0.63%) of MATOPIBA region is under strong signs of degradation, mostly on pasture and grasslands areas, commonly used for grazing. Although the percentage of degraded areas is relatively small, the mapping indicated that the majority of degradation patches are concentrated not only in areas of low resilience, e.g., areas dominated by weakly structured sandy soils, but also where highly stable latosols dominate. More importantly, these areas were frequently affected by fire over the study period. This finding suggests that the combination of unsustainable traditional land management practices, such as fire, the replacement of forest by pasture, and anthropic activities such as inadequate road planning, are the main factor that trigger degradation processes in this Brazilian region. The study results are important for decision makers for defining investment priorities for conservation and for the recovery of degraded areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Community Flood Resilience Categorization Framework,"Coupled with climate change, the expansive developments of urban areas are causing a significant increase in flood-related disasters worldwide. However, most flood risk analysis and categorization efforts have been focused on the hydrologic features of flood hazards (e.g., inundation depth, extent, and duration), rarely considering the resulting long-term losses and recovery time (i.e., the community's flood resilience). This paper aims at developing a data-driven community flood resilience categorization framework that can be utilized for the development of realistic disaster management strategies and proactive risk mitigation measures to better protect urban centers from future catastrophic flood events. This approach considers key resilience goals such as the robustness of the exposed community and its recovery rapidity. Such categorization that calls on the two resilience means, namely resourcefulness and redundancy, can empower decision makers to learn from past events and guide future resilience strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed framework, a data-driven framework was applied on historical mainland flood disaster records collected by the US National Weather Services between 1996 and 2019. Descriptive analysis was conducted to identify the features of this dataset as well as the interdependence between the different variables considered. To further demonstrate the utilization of the developed data-driven framework, a spatial analysis was conducted to quantify community flood resilience across different counties within the affected states. Beyond the work presented in this paper, the developed framework lays the foundation to adopt data driven approaches for disasters prediction to guide proactive risk mitigation measures and develop community resilience management insights. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Climate change and NaTech events: A step towards local-scale awareness and preparedness,"The present paper aims at verifying the awareness and preparedness of urban and local planners to cope with NaTech risk, together with the availability of dedicated tools. Since most of the natural events that can trigger technological hazards are influenced by climate change (i.e. flood, heavy rains, storms, etc.), NaTech risk is expected to be strongly increasing in the next years. However, dedicated NaTech planning actions and methods or tools to support them are still rarely available. The requirements of European Adaptation Strategy for Climate were examined considering the issues posed by the Seveso III Directive in terms of NaTech, focusing on the strategies adopted in the European countries, and in particular in Italy. Based on such analysis, a ‘NaTech tool’ dedicated to local planners was developed. Practical and easy to use methods and procedures were proposed in order to allow the use of the method by the local authorities, in the absence of sectorial experts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Agent-based modelling of post-disaster recovery with remote sensing data,"Disaster risk management, and post-disaster recovery (PDR) in particular, become increasingly important to assure resilient development. Yet, PDR is the most poorly understood phase of the disaster management cycle and can take years or even decades. The physical aspects of the recovery are relatively easy to monitor and evaluate using, e.g. geospatial remote sensing data compared to functional assessments that include social and economic processes. Therefore, there is a need to explore the impacts of different dimensions of the recovery, including individual behaviour and their interactions with socio-economic institutions. In this study, we develop an agent-based model to simulate and explore the PDR process in urban areas of Tacloban, the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Formal and informal (slum) sector households are differentiated in the model to explore their resilience and different recovery patterns. Machine learning-derived land use maps are extracted from remote sensing images for pre- and post-disaster and are used to provide information on physical recovery. We use the empirical model to evaluate two realistic policy scenarios: the construction of relocation sites after a disaster and the investments in improving employment options. We find that the speed of the recovery of the slum dwellers is higher than formal sector households due to the quick reconstruction of slums and the availability of low-income jobs in the first months after the disaster. Finally, the results reveal that the households' commuting distance to their workplaces is one of the critical factors in households’ decision to relocate after a disaster. © 2021 The Author(s)"
Postdrought Recovery Time Across Global Terrestrial Ecosystems,"Drought, as an intermittent disturbance of the water cycle, profoundly impacts the terrestrial ecosystem. Recovery time (RT) of an ecosystem from drought is an important indicator of assessing drought impacts and ecosystem resilience, yet the spatiotemporal pattern of ecosystem postdrought RT remains controversial in existing studies. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of postdrought RT across global terrestrial ecosystems using two observation-based gross primary productivity (GPP) data sets: direct flux-site observations and gridded estimates by upscaling flux-site observations using machine-learning approach. For droughts that occur on average once every 5.2 years, the RT typically ranges between 2 and 8 months, with a global mean RT of ∼6 months. Spatially, both GPP data sets show a significant bilinear relationship between RT and moisture gradient, and that ecosystems in arid and humid regions tend to recover from drought more rapidly than semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems. Additionally, forests show an overall longer RT than shrublands and grasslands. Temporally, global ecosystem RT shows a slight yet significant increasing trend (0.032 months yr−1) during 1982–2010, which is partly caused by the increasing drought for the same period. However, the observed patterns of RT across global bio-climatic zones are not captured by the state-of-the-art land surface models, which exhibit a shorter RT in semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems but longer RT in arid/humid regions, and a larger increasing trend of RT over time (0.069 months yr−1). Our findings provide crucial insights into ecosystem vulnerability to sub-decadal stress events and ecosystem recovery trajectories among diverse bio-climatic regions and highlight potential model deficiencies that should be accounted for in future model developments. © 2021.

"Machine Learning-Based Modeling of Spatio-Temporally Varying Responses of Rainfed Corn Yield to Climate, Soil, and Management in the U.S. Corn Belt","Better understanding the variabilities in crop yield and production is critical to assessing the vulnerability and resilience of food production systems. Both environmental (climatic and edaphic) conditions and management factors affect the variabilities of crop yield. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis in the U.S. Corn Belt to understand and model how rainfed corn yield is affected by climate variability and extremes, soil properties (soil available water capacity, soil organic matter), and management practices (planting date and fertilizer applications). Exploratory data analyses revealed that corn yield responds non-linearly to temperature, while the negative vapor pressure deficit (VPD) effect on corn yield is monotonic and more prominent. Higher mean yield and inter-annual yield variability are found associated with high soil available water capacity, while lower inter-annual yield variability is associated with high soil organic matter (SOM). We also identified region-dependent relationships between planting date and yield and a strong correlation between planting date and the April weather condition (temperature and rainfall). Next, we built machine learning models using the random forest and LASSO algorithms, respectively, to predict corn yield with all climatic, soil properties, and management factors. The random forest model achieved a high prediction accuracy for annual yield at county level as early as in July (R2 = 0.781) and outperformed LASSO. The gained insights from this study lead to improved understanding of how corn yield responds to climate variability and projected change in the U.S. Corn Belt and globally. © Copyright © 2021 Xu, Guan, Peng, Wei and Zhao."
Pre-event Resilience Enhancement Strategy for Distribution Systems Based on Dueling DDQN,"Global warming has led to an increasing number of extreme weather events, sequential attacks of such events cause significant damage to distribution grids, and power utilities have to spend huge amounts of resources to strengthen grid structures. To improve the pre-event resilience of distribution systems in the face of extreme events while saving costs, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based distribution grid hardening strategy that combines the failure rate of hardened components with the hardening cost to form a bi-objective optimization model. Simulations are performed in the IEEE 37-bus system to verify that the hardening strategy found by the proposed approach can significantly improve system resilience under different hardening conditions and disaster situations. © 2021 IEEE."
A deep learning model for predicting climate-induced disasters,"The increased severity and frequency of Climate-Induced Disasters (CID) including those attributed to hydrological, meteorological, and climatological effects have been testing the resilience of cities worldwide. The World Economic Forum highlighted—in its 2020 Global Risk Report—that from 2018 to 2020, three of the top five risks with respect to likelihood and impact are climate related with extreme weather events being the highest ranked risk in terms of likelihood. To alleviate the adverse impacts of CID on cities, this paper aims at predicting the occurrence of CID by linking different climate change indices to historical disaster records. In this respect, a deep learning model was developed for spatial–temporal disaster occurrence prediction. To demonstrate its application, flood disaster data from the Canadian Disaster Database was linked to climate change indices data in Ontario in order to train, test and validate the developed model. The results of the demonstration application showed that the model was able to predict flood disasters with an accuracy of around 96%. In addition to its association with precipitation indices, the study results affirm that flood disasters are closely linked to temperature-related features including the daily temperature gradient, and the number of days with minimum temperature below zero. This work introduces a new perspective in CID prediction, based on historical disaster data, global climate models, and climate change metrics, in an attempt to enhance urban resilience and mitigate CID risks on cities worldwide. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature."
A mixed approach for urban flood prediction using Machine Learning and GIS,"Extreme weather conditions, as one of many effects of climate change, is expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of environmental disasters. In parallel, urban centres are also expected to grow significantly in the next years, making necessary to implement the adequate mechanisms to tackle such threats, more specifically flooding. This project aims to develop a flood prediction system using a combination of Machine Learning classifiers along with GIS techniques to be used as an effective tool for urban management and resilience planning. This approach can establish sensible factors and risk indices for the occurrence of floods at the city level, which could be instrumental for outlining a long-term strategy for Smart Cities. The most performant Machine Learning model was a Random Forest, with a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.77 and an Accuracy of 0.96. To support and extend the capabilities of the Machine Learning model, a GIS model was developed to find areas with higher likelihood of being flooded under critical weather conditions. Therefore, hot spots were defined for the entire city given the observed flood history. The scores obtained from the Random Forest model and the Hot Spot analysis were then combined to create a flood risk index. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Infrastructure performance prediction under Climate-Induced Disasters using data analytics,"The frequency of Climate-induced Disasters (CID) has tripled in the last three decades, driving the World Economic Forum to identify them as the most likely and most impactful risks worldwide. With more than 70% of the world population expected to be living in cities by 2050, ensuring the resilience of urban infrastructure systems under CID is crucial. The present work employs data analytics and machine learning techniques to develop a performance prediction framework for infrastructure systems under CID. The framework encompasses four stages related to: extracting meaningful information about the impact of CID on infrastructure systems and identifying the latter's performance; investigating the relationship between different CID attributes and previously identified system performance; employing data imputation using unsupervised machine learning techniques; and developing and testing a supervised machine learning model based on the different influencing CID attributes. To demonstrate its application, the developed framework is applied to disaster data compiled by the National Weather Services between 1996 and 2019 in the state of New York. The analysis results showed that: i) power systems in New York are the most vulnerable infrastructure to CID, and particularly to wind-related hazards; ii) power system performance level depends on hazard-system interactions rather than solely hazard characteristics; and iii) a 4-predictors random forest-based model can effectively predict power system performance with an accuracy of 89%. This work is expected to aid stakeholders in developing spatio-temporal preparedness plans under CID, which can facilitate mitigating the adverse impacts of CID on infrastructure systems and improve their resilience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
Climate change and specialty coffee potential in Ethiopia,"Current climate change impact studies on coffee have not considered impact on coffee typicities that depend on local microclimatic, topographic and soil characteristics. Thus, this study aims to provide a quantitative risk assessment of the impact of climate change on suitability of five premium specialty coffees in Ethiopia. We implement an ensemble model of three machine learning algorithms to predict current and future (2030s, 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s) suitability for each specialty coffee under four Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Results show that the importance of variables determining coffee suitability in the combined model is different from those for specialty coffees despite the climatic factors remaining more important in determining suitability than topographic and soil variables. Our model predicts that 27% of the country is generally suitable for coffee, and of this area, only up to 30% is suitable for specialty coffees. The impact modelling showed that the combined model projects a net gain in coffee production suitability under climate change in general but losses in five out of the six modelled specialty coffee growing areas. We conclude that depending on drivers of suitability and projected impacts, climate change will significantly affect the Ethiopian speciality coffee sector and area-specific adaptation measures are required to build resilience. © 2021, The Author(s)."
A novel framework for risk assessment and resilience of critical infrastructure towards climate change,"The persistent extreme weather events (floods, droughts, heatwaves, etc.) are increasing the risks towards critical infrastructure (C.I). Therefore, it is essential to enhance the resilience of our C.I to withstand such events in the present and future. Here, a review of current and projected impacts of climate change is conducted on extreme events and on possible implications on C.I is carried out, which suggests that such events can have a severe impact on C.Is. Also, two studies on the behaviour of precipitation extremes and temporal evolution of drought across India are carried out, taking into account the corresponding impacts on C.Is. It indicated that north-western, north-eastern westernmost regions and western Ghats are highly susceptible to floods and northern, central-eastern, western, and central regions are prone towards co-occurrence of floods and droughts. Also, a case study on Kharif paddy yield forecasting using different machine learning (ML) models is carried out, where the random forest was found to be the most suitable model for yield prediction. Finally, we put forward a robust framework for risk assessment and improving the resilience of C.Is based upon the principles of flexibility, diversity, and industrial ecology, incorporating both short-term and long-term impacts of climate risk. © 2020"
A human-centred assessment framework to prioritise heat mitigation efforts for active travel at city scale,"Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
Utilizing world urban database and access portal tools (WUDAPT) and machine learning to facilitate spatial estimation of heatwave patterns,"Climate change lead to more intense, higher frequent and prolonged heat extremes. Understanding the spatial pattern of heatwave is vital for providing the corresponding weather services, making climate change adaptation strategies and heat-health actions. In this study, we present an approach to estimate the heatwave spatial patterns by utilizing the WUDAPT Level 0 data and machine learning. The analysis is based on two years (2009 and 2016) of air temperature data from 86 meteorological monitoring stations in Guangdong province of China, a subtropical region with frequent hot and sultry weather in summer. First, heatwave conditions were quantified by calculating the number of hot days and frequency of heatwave events in each year and used as the response variables. Then, random forest models were built by using a geospatial dataset consisting of WUDAPT and urban canopy parameters (UCP) as predictor variables. Based on the resultant models, spatial patterns of heatwave were estimated and mapped at 100 m spatial-resolution. The results show that this approach is able to estimate heatwave spatial patterns using open data and inform urban policy and decision-making. The study is also a new perspective and a feasible pathway of utilizing WUDPAT Level 0 product to facilitate urban environment applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Flood risk dynamics and adaptation analyses for coastal cities based on internet big data and hydrology-hydrodynamic models,"Climate change, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and rapid urbanization are likely to increase flood risk in low-lying coastal cities in the future, posing serious challenges to urban sustainability. To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind wave. tide. 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31-49 km(2) (4%-6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180-206 km(2) (14%-16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6-2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million-900 million (104.0 million-133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%-79% and 88%-90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion-5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion-0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion-9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion-1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios arc 1.9-2.4 and 7.9-9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities."
Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach,"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occur-rence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, af-fecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July-December) were ob-tained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Tempera-ture, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occur-rence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precip-itation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue.

Forest Resistance and Resilience to 2002 Drought in Northern China,"Drought can weaken forest activity and even lead to forest mortality, and the response of different forest types to drought can be diverse. Deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and deciduous needleleaf forest (DNF) are two of the majority forest types in northern China. In this region, a severe drought event happened in 2002. However, due to the lack of data, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the ecosystem stability of different forest types here remain unclear. In this study, we used a machine learning approach (model tree ensemble, MTE) to drive fluxsite gross primary productivity (GPP), combined with remote sensing-based GPP and a vegetation index data (EVI), to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of resistance and resilience of DNF and DBF in northern China during and after the 2002 drought. The results showed that the DBFs were more acclimatized to the drought, while the resistance and resilience of DNF and DBF were diverse under different consecutive drought events. These results could be suggestive for forest conservation and vegetation modeling."
"Incorporating Climate Change in Pavement Maintenance Policies: Application to Temperature Rise in the Isfahan County, Iran","Although temperature rise is imminent in Iran and could damage asphalt pavements, no national guide exists to adapt them. To ensure the sustainability of pavements against temperature rise, a county-level methodology based on machine-learning algorithms was developed. To show the applicability of the framework, the Isfahan County was studied. The county's climate was found to change from cold-semi-desert to relatively-warm-semidesert in future decades. Then, optimal maintenance policies before and after climate change were identified. It was concluded that optimal policies of arterial roads before and after climate change were more intense than those of local roads. Furthermore, optimal policies after climate change were more intense than those before climate change at additional costs of 1379.57 MR/KM and 632.49 MR/KM respectively for arterial and local roads. The same methodology could be applied to sustainably adapt asphalt pavements of other counties. To validate the research, a questionnaire survey of pavement management and climate change experts was done. The experts confirmed that the methodology facilitates achieving sustainable development goals #9, #11, and #13 by improving maintenance budget allocation, enhancing policy-makers communication with authorities, maintaining adequate technical and end-user levels of service, and adapting pavements to climate change through cost-effective and performance-effective maintenance policies."
"A multi-hazard map-based flooding, gully erosion, forest fires, and earthquakes in Iran","We used three state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (boosted regression tree, random forest, and support vector machine) to produce a multi-hazard (MHR) map illustrating areas susceptible to flooding, gully erosion, forest fires, and earthquakes in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran. The earthquake hazard map was derived from a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. The mean decrease Gini (MDG) method was implemented to determine the relative importance of effective factors on the spatial occurrence of each of the four hazards. Area under the curve (AUC) plots, based on a validation dataset, were created for the maps generated using the three algorithms to compare the results. The random forest model had the highest predictive accuracy, with AUC values of 0.994, 0.982, and 0.885 for gully erosion, flooding, and forest fires, respectively. Approximately 41%, 40%, 28%, and 3% of the study area are at risk of forest fires, earthquakes, floods, and gully erosion, respectively."
"Restoration of forest resilience to fire from old trees is possible across a large Colorado dry-forest landscape by 2060, but only under the Paris 1.5 degrees C goal","Fire-prone dry forests often face increasing fires from climate change with low resistance and resilience due to logging of large, old fire-resistant trees. Their restoration across large landscapes is constrained by limited mature trees, physical settings, and protection. Active restoration has been costly and shown limited effectiveness, but lower cost passive restoration is less studied. I used GIS and machine learning to see whether passive restoration of old trees could overcome constraints in time, by 2060, across 667,000 ha of montane forests in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado, where temperatures are increasing faster than the global average. Random Forest models of physical locations of reconstructed historical old growth (OG) and relatively frequent fire (RFF) show historical OG with RFF was favored between 6.1 and 7.9 degrees C annual mean temperatures. Random Forest models projected that similar temperature-suitable locations were moved into the current middle montane ca 2015, and would be extended to just below the upper limit of the montane if the Paris 1.5 degrees C goal is reached, but beyond if not. US Forest Service common stand exam data, which covered similar to 15% of the study area and included 26,149 tree ages, show the highest potential for restoring resistance and resilience from old trees is a >= 120-year age class. This class could become a >= 160-year age class, which meets old-growth age criteria, over 81% of the area by ca 2060, nearly fully restoring historical old-growth levels. Half this age class is already protected, and much of the remainder could be retained using evidence-based diameter caps. Datasets thus are sufficient to show that passive restoration of old-tree resistance and resilience to fire is feasible by ca 2060 across a large montane landscape, although contingent on global success in achieving the Paris 1.5 degrees C goal. Passive restoration may be viable elsewhere."
Global migration is driven by the complex interplay between environmental and social factors,"Migration manifests an important response and adaptation measure to changes in the environment and socioeconomic conditions. In a time when environmental stressors and risks are unprecedentedly increasing, understanding the interplay between the underlying factors driving migration is of high importance. While the relationships between environmental and socioeconomic drivers have been identified conceptually, the comprehensive global-scale spatial quantification of their interactions is in its infancy. Here, we performed a geospatial analysis of gridded global net migration from 1990 to 2000 using a novel machine learning approach which analyses the interplay between a set of societal and environmental factors simultaneously at the place of origins (areas of net-negative migration) and destinations (areas of net-positive migration). We diagnosed the importance of eight environmental and societal factors in explaining migration for each country, globally. Nearly half of global in- and out-migration took place in the areas characterized by low adaptive capacity and high environmental stress. Regardless of the income level, income was the key factor in explaining net-migration in half of the countries. Slow-onset environmental factors, drought and water risk, were found to be the dominant environmental variables globally. Our study highlights that factors representing human capacity need to be incorporated into the quantitative diagnosis of environmental migration more rigorously."
Next generation agricultural stress index system (Asis) for agricultural drought monitoring,"Over the past 40 years, drought has affected more people in the world than any other natural hazard, affecting large segments of the population and destroying the natural resource base, livestock and livelihoods. Recent projections show that drought events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. According to studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 83% of all damages and losses caused globally by drought between 2006 and 2016 have been absorbed by agriculture, putting a large part of the world’s population at risk of food insecurity. This study shows the advantage of scaling-up FAO’s agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system (ASIS) and building the bridge with the anticipatory action, drought financial mechanisms, social protection and other initiatives for preventing the deterioration of food security and strengthening resilience. The results of the methodology that is based on and supported by the digital innovation, machine learning, matured knowledge and experiences accumulated over the past 10 years are illustrated with practical examples from different countries, ecological environments and crops. A fused time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from Meteorological Operational satellite (METOP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was used to produce a consistent time series of a vegetation health index (VHI) at 1 km spatial resolution from 1984 to present. VHI is multiplied by the crop coefficient (kc) to provide more responsiveness to the VHI anomaly that occurs during sensitive phenological phases to water stress such as a flowering and grain filling. The weighted VHI (wVHI) is integrated from the start of the season (SOS) up to the end of season (EOS). Once the temporal analysis of wVHI is completed, the spatial average is calculated using the values of pixels within a specific crop mask and administrative unit. The system proposed different vegetation indices to assess the impact of drought in agriculture; including an agricultural drought forecast that provide more time to the decision makers for implementing anticipatory actions to mitigate the drought in agriculture. Next generation agricultural stress index system (ASIS) offers full capabilities to support: parametric crop insurance, social protection schemes, early action, national drought management plans and to guide public investments. © 2021 by the author.

"Descriptive and visual summaries of disaster events using artificial intelligence techniques: case studies of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria","People increasingly use microblogging platforms such as Twitter during natural disasters and emergencies. Research studies have revealed the usefulness of the data available on Twitter for several disaster response tasks. However, making sense of social media data is a challenging task due to several reasons such as limitations of available tools to analyse high-volume and high-velocity data streams, dealing with information overload, among others. To eliminate such limitations, in this work, we first show that textual and imagery content on social media provide complementary information useful to improve situational awareness. We then explore ways in which various Artificial Intelligence techniques from Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision fields can exploit such complementary information generated during disaster events. Finally, we propose a methodological approach that combines several computational techniques effectively in a unified framework to help humanitarian organisations in their relief efforts. We conduct extensive experiments using textual and imagery content from millions of tweets posted during the three major disaster events in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season. Our study reveals that the distributions of various types of useful information can inform crisis managers and responders and facilitate the development of future automated systems for disaster management."
Assessing and mapping multi-hazard risk susceptibility using a machine learning technique,"The aim of the current study was to suggest a multi-hazard probability assessment in Fars Province, Shiraz City, and its four strategic watersheds. At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values. These results allow us to forecast the spatial behavior of such multi-hazard events, and researchers and stakeholders alike can apply them to evaluate hazards under various mitigation scenarios."
"Regional climate resilience index: A novel multimethod comparative approach for indicator development, empirical validation and implementation","High uncertainty in the occurrence of extreme events and disasters have made resilience-building an imperative part of society. Resilience assessment is an important tool in this context. Resilience is multidimensional as well as place-, scale- and time-specific, which requires a comprehensive approach for measuring and analysing. In this regard, composite indicators are preferred, and extensive literature is available on resilience indices on all spatial and temporal scales as well as hazard-specific or multi-hazard related indicators. However, transparent, robust, validated and transferable metrics are still missing from the scientific discourse. Hence, the research follows a novel composite index development approach: First, to develop and operationalise climate resilience on the county level in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany; second, to develop multiple composite indices in order to assess the impact of the construction methodology to increase transparency and decrease uncertainty; third, validating the index by statistical as well as empirical data and machine learning models - which is a novel endeavour so far. The results underscored that the two-step inclusive validation of data-driven statistical analysis in combination with empirical data proved to be essential in developing the index during the selection and aggregation of indicators. The results also highlighted a lower climate resilience of rural regions compared to metropolitan regions despite their better environmental status. Overall, machine learning proved to be essential in understanding and linking indicators and indices to policy, resilience and empirical data. The research contributes to a better understanding of climate resilience as well as to the methodological construction of composite indicators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
A machine learning framework for multi-hazards modeling and mapping in a mountainous area,"This study sought to produce an accurate multi-hazard risk map for a mountainous region of Iran. The study area is in southwestern Iran. The region has experienced numerous extreme natural events in recent decades. This study models the probabilities of snow avalanches, landslides, wildfires, land subsidence, and floods using machine learning models that include support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized linear model (GLM). Climatic, topographic, geological, social, and morphological factors were the main input variables used. The data were obtained from several sources. The accuracies of GLM, SVM, and functional discriminant analysis (FDA) models indicate that SVM is the most accurate for predicting landslides, land subsidence, and flood hazards in the study area. GLM is the best algorithm for wildfire mapping, and FDA is the most accurate model for predicting snow avalanche risk. The values of AUC (area under curve) for all five hazards using the best models are greater than 0.8, demonstrating that the model’s predictive abilities are acceptable. A machine learning approach can prove to be very useful tool for hazard management and disaster mitigation, particularly for multi-hazard modeling. The predictive maps produce valuable baselines for risk management in the study area, providing evidence to manage future human interaction with hazards. © 2020, The Author(s)."
The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture Sector in ASEAN,"This study purposes to estimate climate change effect on agriculture sector in ASEAN by using the copula-based stochastic frontier approach to evaluate the technical efficiency and factors that affect agriculture production. Panel data of land, labour, fertilizer, and temperature in seven countries in ASEAN including Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia collected from 2002-2016 were used for estimating the model. The results presented that the land, labour, and fertilizer consumption according to the agriculture have positive and significant effects on agricultural production. The most interesting point from this study, found that there is a negative effect on agriculture production related by the climate change. Additionally, this study provides the most appropriate tools to analyse climate change impacts on ASEAN agriculture and the potential options for adaptation in the agriculture sector. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
Unsupervised domain adaptation with self-attention for post-disaster building damage detection,"Fast assessment of damaged buildings is important for post-disaster rescue operations. Building damage detection leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques has become a popular research focus in recent years. Although supervised learning approaches have made considerable improvement for damaged building assessment, rapidly deploying supervised classification is still difficult due to the complexity in obtaining a large number of labeled samples in the aftermath of disasters. We propose an unsupervised self-attention domain adaptation (USADA) model, which transforms instances of the source domain to those of the target domain in pixel space, to address the aforementioned issue. The proposed USADA consists of three parts: a set of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a classifier, and a self-attention module. The GAN adapts source domain images to ensure their similarity to target domain images. Once adapted, the classifier can be trained using the adapted images along with the original images of the source domain to classify damaged buildings. The self-attention module is introduced to maintain the foreground of the generated images conditioned on source domain images for generating plausible samples. As a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy, Maria, and Irma, are used as the source and target domain datasets in our experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that classification accuracies of 68.1% and 84.1% are achieved, and our method obtains improvements of 2.0% and 3.6% against pixel-level domain adaptation, which is the basis of our model. © 2020 The Authors"
Machine Learning on Satellite Radar Images to Estimate Damages after Natural Disasters,"Satellite radar imaging from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is a remote sensing technology that captures ground surface level changes at a relatively high resolution. This technology has been used in many applications, one of which is the estimation of damages after natural disasters, such as wildfire, earthquake, and hurricane events. An efficient and accurate assessment of damages after natural catastrophe events allows public and private sectors to quickly respond in order to mitigate losses and to better prepare for disaster relief. Advances in machine learning and image processing techniques can be applied to this dataset to survey large areas and estimate property damages. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based approach for taking satellite radar images and geographical data as inputs to classify the damage status of individual buildings after a major wildfire event. We believe the demonstration of this damage estimation methodology and its application to real world natural disaster events will have a high potential to improve social resilience. © 2020 Owner/Author."
Intensified burn severity in California's northern coastal mountains by drier climatic condition,"The severity of wildfire burns in interior lands of western US ecosystems has been increasing. However, less is known about its coastal mountain ecosystems, especially under extreme weather conditions, raising concerns about the vulnerability of these populated areas to catastrophic fires. Here we examine the fine-scale association between burn severity and a suite of environmental drivers including explicit fuel information, weather, climate, and topography, for diverse ecosystems in California's northern coastal mountains. Burn severity was quantified using Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat multispectral imagery during 1984-2017. We found a significant increasing trend in burned areas and severity. During low-precipitation years, areas that burned had much lower fuel moisture and higher climatic water deficit than in wetter years, and the percentage of high-severity areas doubled, especially during the most recent 2012-2016 drought. The random forest (RF) machine learning model achieved overall accuracy of 79% in classifying categories of burn severity. Aspect, slope, fuel type and availability, and temperature were the most important drivers, based on both classification and regression RF models. We further examined the importance of drivers under four climatic conditions: dry vs. wet years, and during two extended drought periods (the 2012-2016 warmer drought vs. the 1987-1992 drought). During warm and dry years, the spatial variability of burn severity was a mixed effect of slope, long-term minimum temperature, fuel amount, and fuel moisture. In contrast, climatic water deficit and short-term weather became dominant factors for fires during wetter years. These results suggest that relative importance of drivers for burn severity in the broader domain of California's northern coastal mountains varied with weather scenarios, especially when exacerbated by warm and extended drought. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting areas with high burn severity risk for fire adaptation and mitigation strategies in a changing climate and intensifying extremes. © 2020 The Author(s).

No perfect storm for crop yield failure in Germany,"Large-scale crop yield failures are increasingly associated with food price spikes and food insecurity and are a large source of income risk for farmers. While the evidence linking extreme weather to yield failures is clear, consensus on the broader set of weather drivers and conditions responsible for recent yield failures is lacking. We investigate this for the case of four major crops in Germany over the past 20 years using a combination of machine learning and process-based modelling. Our results confirm that years associated with widespread yield failures across crops were generally associated with severe drought, such as in 2018 and to a lesser extent 2003. However, for years with more localized yield failures and large differences in spatial patterns of yield failures between crops, no single driver or combination of drivers was identified. Relatively large residuals of unexplained variation likely indicate the importance of non-weather related factors, such as management (pest, weed and nutrient management and possible interactions with weather) explaining yield failures. Models to inform adaptation planning at farm, market or policy levels are here suggested to require consideration of cumulative resource capture and use, as well as effects of extreme events, the latter largely missing in process-based models. However, increasingly novel combinations of weather events under climate change may limit the extent to which data driven methods can replace process-based models in risk assessments. © 2020 The Author(s).

Night and day: The influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on remotely sensed land surface temperature,"The characteristics of urban land surfaces contribute to the urban heat island, and, in turn, can exacerbate the severity of heat wave impacts. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question “What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?” To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."
Geospatiality of climate change perceptions on coastal regions: A systematic bibliometric analysis,"Climate change requires joint actions between government and local actors. Understanding the perception of people and communities is critical for designing climate change adaptation strategies. Those most affected by climate change are populations in coastal regions that face extreme weather events and sea-level increases. In this article, geospatial perception of climate change is identified, and the research parameters are quantified. In addition to investigating the correlations of hotspots on the topic of climate change perception with a focus on coastal communities, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to examine the research interactions. A total of 27,138 articles sources from Google Scholar and Scopus were analyzed. A systematic method was used for data processing combining bibliometric analysis and machine learning. Publication trends were analyzed in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Publications in English (87%) were selected for network and data mining analysis. Most of the research was conducted in the USA, followed by India and China. The main research methods were identified through correlation networks. In many cases, social studies of perception are related to climatic methods and vegetation analysis supported by GIS. The analysis of keywords identified ten research topics: adaptation, risk, community, local, impact, livelihood, farmer, household, strategy, and variability. “Adaptation” is in the core of the correlation network of all keywords. The interdisciplinary analysis between social and environmental factors, suggest improvements are needed for research in this field. A single method cannot address understanding of a phenomenon as complicated as the socio-environmental. This study provides valuable information for future research by clarifying the current context of perception work carried out in the coastal regions; and identifying the tools best suited for carrying out this type of research. © 2020"
Using deep learning and social network analysis to understand and manage extreme flooding,"Combining machine learning with social network analysis (SNA) can leverage vast amounts of social media data to better respond to crises. We present a case study using Twitter data from the March 2019 Nebraska floods in the United States, which caused over $1 billion in damage in the state and widespread evacuations of residents. We use a subset of machine learning, deep learning (DL), to classify text content of 11,982 tweets, and we integrate that with SNA to understand the structure of tweet interactions. Our DL approach pre-trains our model with a DL language technique, BERT, and then trains the model using the standard training dataset to sort a dataset of tweets into classes tailored to crisis events. Several performance measures demonstrate that our two-tiered trained model improves domain adaptation and generalization across different extreme weather event types. This approach identifies the role of Twitter during the damage containment stage of the flood. Our SNA identifies accounts that function as primary sources of information on Twitter. Together, these two approaches help crisis managers filter large volumes of data and overcome challenges faced by simple statistical models and other computational techniques to provide useful information during crises like flooding. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
Using OpenStreetMap data and machine learning to generate socio-economic indicators,"Socio-economic indicators are key to understanding societal challenges. They disassemble complex phenomena to gain insights and deepen understanding. Specific subsets of indicators have been developed to describe sustainability, human development, vulnerability, risk, resilience and climate change adaptation. Nonetheless, insufficient quality and availability of data often limit their explanatory power. Spatial and temporal resolution are often not at a scale appropriate for monitoring. Socio-economic indicators are mostly provided by governmental institutions and are therefore limited to administrative boundaries. Furthermore, different methodological computation approaches for the same indicator impair comparability between countries and regions. OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides an unparalleled standardized global database with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Surprisingly, the potential of OSM seems largely unexplored in this context. In this study, we used machine learning to predict four exemplary socio-economic indicators for municipalities based on OSM. By comparing the predictive power of neural networks to statistical regression models, we evaluated the unhinged resources of OSM for indicator development. OSM provides prospects for monitoring across administrative boundaries, interdisciplinary topics, and semi-quantitative factors like social cohesion. Further research is still required to, for example, determine the impact of regional and international differences in user contributions on the outputs. Nonetheless, this database can provide meaningful insight into otherwise unknown spatial differences in social, environmental or economic inequalities. © 2020 by the authors.

"Landslide susceptibility mapping with random forest model for Ordu, Turkey","Landslides are among commonly observed natural hazards all over the world and can be quite destructive for infrastructure and in settlement areas. Their occurrences are often related with extreme meteorological events and seismic activities. Preparation of landslide susceptibility maps is important for disaster mitigation efforts and to increase the resilience. The factors effective on landslide susceptibility map production depend mainly on the topography, land use and the geological characteristics of the region. The up-to-date and accurate data needed for extracting the effective parameters can be obtained by using photogrammetric techniques with high spatial resolution. Data driven ensemble methods are being increasingly used for landslide susceptibility map production and accurate results can be obtained. In this study, regional landslide susceptibility map of a landslide-prone area in a part of Ordu Province in northern Turkey is produced using topographic and lithological parameters by employing the random forest method. An actual landslide inventory delineated manually by geologists using the produced orthophotos and the digital terrain model (DTM) is used for training the model. The results show that an accuracy of 83% and precision of 92% can obtained from the data and the random forest method. The approach can be applied for generation of regional susceptibility maps semi-automatically. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives."
Best optimizer selection for predicting bushfire occurrences using deep learning,"Abstract: Natural disasters like bushfires pose a catastrophic threat to the Australia and the world’s territorial areas. This fire spreads in a wide area within seconds, and therefore, it is complicated and challenging to mitigate. To minimize risk and increase resilience, identifying bushfire occurrences beforehand and takes necessary actions is critically important. This study focuses on using deep learning technology for predicting bushfire occurrences using real weather data in any given location. Real-time and off-line weather data was collected using Weather Underground API, from 2012 to 2017 (N= 128 , 329). The obtained weather data are temperature, dew point, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, and daily rain. An algorithm was developed to collect this data automatically from any destination. Six different optimizer models were analyzed that use in deep learning technology. Then, the comparison was carried out to identify the best model. Selecting an optimizer for training the neural network, in this case, deep learning is a challenging task. Six best optimizers were chosen to compare and identify the best optimizer to estimate potential fire occurrences in given locations. The six optimizers; Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam, and SGD were compared based on their processing time, prediction accuracy and error. Our findings suggest Adagrad optimizer provides less prediction time which is a critical factor for fast-spreading bushfires. Our work provides a data collection model for disaster prediction, which could be utilized to collect climatic characteristics and topographical characteristics in with larger samples. The developed methodology could be utilized as a natural disaster prediction model for precise predictions with less error and processing time using real-time data. This study provides an enhanced understanding of finding the locations that fire starts or spot fires which are more likely to occur, and lead to identifying of fire starts that are more likely to spread.

A serious gaming framework for decision support on hydrological hazards,"With increasing population and human intervention on the natural environment, hazards are a growing threat, coming in many forms, including floods, droughts, soil erosion, and water pollution. A key approach to mitigate hydrological disaster risk at the community level is informed planning with decision support systems. The literature shows emerging efforts on multi-hazard decision support systems for hydrological disasters and demonstrates the need for an engaging, accessible, and collaborative serious game environment facilitating the relationship between the environment and communities. In this study, a web-based decision support tool (DST) was developed for hydrological multi-hazard analysis while employing gamification techniques to introduce a competitive element. The serious gaming environment provides functionalities for intuitive management, visualization, and analysis of geospatial, hydrological, and economic data to help stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding hydrological hazard preparedness and response. Major contributions of the presented DST include involving the community in environmental decision making by reducing the technical complexity required for analysis, increasing community awareness for the environmental and socio-economic consequences of hydrological hazards, and allowing stakeholders to discover and discuss potential trade-offs to hazardous scenarios considering the limitations in budget, regulations, and technicality. The paper describes the software design approaches and system architecture applied for a modular, secure, and scalable software as well as the framework's intuitive web-based user interfaces for real-time and collaborative data analysis and damage assessment. Finally, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the usability of DST in a formal setting and to measure user satisfaction with surveys. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
Domain Adaptation with Reconstruction for Disaster Tweet Classification,"Identifying critical information in real time in the beginning of a disaster is a challenging but important task. This task has been recently addressed using domain adaptation approaches, which eliminate the need for target labeled data, and can thus accelerate the process of identifying useful information. We propose to investigate the effectiveness of the Domain Reconstruction Classification Network (DRCN) approach on disaster tweets. DRCN adapts information from target data by reconstructing it with an autoencoder. Experimental results using a sequence-to-sequence autoencodershow that the DRCN approach can improve the performance of both supervised and domain adaptation baseline models. © 2020 ACM."
Data fusion and artificial neural networks for modelling crop disease severity,"This paper analyzes the possibility of applying data fusion combined with artificial neural networks (ANN) on a dataset combining hard and soft data for prediction of one of the most devastating crop diseases of winter wheat, i.e., Septoria Tritici (Zymoseptoria tritici). In advanced decision support systems for crop protection choices, disease models form a major component. They reproduce the biophysical processes of disease development and temporal spread as a set of rules or processes to predict disease risk value. However, the adaptation of these rules or processes to incorporate the effects of climate change is complex and requires extensive rework. To remedy this issue, statistical machine learning techniques have been introduced to model disease severity percentage for some diseases. However, the use of artificial neural networks has been limited (mainly to image data) and is unexplored for Septoria Tritici. This paper explores the use of Feed Forward neural networks on fused tabular data for the task of disease severity modelling. First, ten years of trial data ranging from 2008 to 2018 across Europe is used for the creation of the new tabular dataset with a fusion of all important data sources baring impact on disease development: Field-specific data, weather data, crop growth stages, and disease severity observation made by human trial operators (response variable). Next, two implementation architectures of Feed Forward neural networks on tabular data are employed: a) standard architecture with backpropagation, drop out regularization, and batch normalization and b) advanced architecture with improvements such as cyclic learning rate and cosine annealing. The advanced architecture is able to better model the data and make estimations of disease severity with a difference of +-10% giving a better quantifiable estimate of disease stress. For better outreach to farmers, a technique to incorporate such modelling techniques into the well established Decision Support Systems is also presented. © 2020 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF)."
Impacts of climate change on agro-climatic suitability of major food crops in Ghana,"Climate change is projected to impact food production stability in many tropical countries through impacts on crop potential. However, without quantitative assessments of where, by how much and to what extent crop production is possible now and under future climatic conditions, efforts to design and implement adaptation strategies under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Action Plans (NAP) are unsystematic. In this study, we used extreme gradient boosting, a machine learning approach to model the current climatic suitability for maize, sorghum, cassava and groundnut in Ghana using yield data and agronomically important variables. We then used multi-model future climate projections for the 2050s and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) to predict changes in the suitability range of these crops. We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for all crops (AUC = 0.81-0.87). Precipitation-based factors are suggested as most important in determining crop suitability, though the importance is crop-specific. Under projected climatic conditions, optimal suitability areas will decrease for all crops except for groundnuts under RCP8.5 (no change: 0%), with greatest losses for maize (12% under RCP2.6 and 14% under RCP8.5). Under current climatic conditions, 18% of Ghana has optimal suitability for two crops, 2% for three crops with no area having optimal suitability for all the four crops. Under projected climatic conditions, areas with optimal suitability for two and three crops will decrease by 12% as areas having moderate and marginal conditions for multiple crops increase. We also found that although the distribution of multiple crop suitability is spatially distinct, cassava and groundnut will be more simultaneously suitable for the south while groundnut and sorghum will be more suitable for the northern parts of Ghana under projected climatic conditions. © 2020 Chemura et al."
Forecast accuracy matters for hurricane damage,"I analyze damage from hurricane strikes on the United States since 1955. Using machine learning methods to select the most important drivers for damage, I show that large errors in a hurricane’s predicted landfall location result in higher damage. This relationship holds across a wide range of model specifications and when controlling for ex-ante uncertainty and potential endogeneity. Using a counterfactual exercise I find that the cumulative reduction in damage from forecast improvements since 1970 is about $82 billion, which exceeds the U.S. government’s spending on the forecasts and private willingness to pay for them. © 2020 by the authors.

Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China,"China, with the world's largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800 million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400–1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48×48 corresponding to 480×480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10×10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32×32 to 64×64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS)"
Evaluation and prediction of transportation resilience under extreme weather events: A diffusion graph convolutional approach,"Resilience offers a broad social-technical framework to deal with breakdown, response and recovery of transportation networks adapting to various disruptions. Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
"Hyper-local, efficient extreme heat projection and analysis using machine learning to augment a hybrid dynamical-statistical downscaling technique","This paper describes a scalable system for quantifying hyper-local heat stress in urban environments and its expected response within the changing climate. A hybrid dynamical-statistical downscaling approach links Global Climate Models (GCMs) with dynamically downscaled extreme heat events using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Downscaled historical simulations in WRF incorporate urban canopy physics to better describe localized land surface details in the urban environment relevant to extreme heat. This downscaled library is then used in an analog-based approach. This contribution reports a series of enhancements to existing analog-based methods which can efficiently produce more detailed results. The system here uses advanced statistical methods and simple machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize analog selection, perform spatially-consistent bias correction, and decompose patterns of extreme heat into dynamic components such as the land-sea contrast and inland sea-breeze penetration. Hindcast projections are validated against observational data from in-situ weather observing stations. The results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of this system as it is deployed in cloud-based architectures with parallelized code. Downscaled predictions are equally applicable to heat stress at weather and climate time scales, supporting infrastructure resilience and adaptation, and emergency response. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
"Energy crops in marginal areas: Scenario-based assessment through ecosystem services, as support to sustainable development","Starting from the identification of marginal areas, this work presents a possible physical–mathematical approach as a support to landscape planning, based on the pragmatic determination of the predictable environmental effects connected to land use changes (LUC) and related to objective and quantitative ecological indicators for environmental impact assessment. “Fringe areas”, which are more suitable to change in a medium-short time frame, were determined through a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (S-MCDA) process. Three land use changes scenarios were identified and analysed, namely: the current situation, energy crop cultivation in marginal lands, and the possible abandonment of lands such as these. Energy crop cultivation in marginal lands is widely considered to be a useful opportunity for farmers, against the progressive risk of under-utilization or abandonment; nevertheless, the large areas needed can cause important environmental side-effects. In order to assess the possible variations in environmental components in the ex-ante planning phase, scenarios were assessed in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystems services (using both monetary and indexes approach), focusing also on possible environmental fragmentation analysis by means of landscape metrics, which are simple measures used to deepen landscape configuration and structure. The S-MCDA process allowed about 10% of the study area with less favourable environmental conditions to be defined, where land use change is desirable in a medium-short time frame. For the energy crops scenario, the ecosystem services (ESs) approach highlights positive repercussions in terms of habitat quality and biodiversity value. Similar trends are highlighted by different ESs assessment methods adopted (monetary and indexes), confirming themselves. Also, landscape pattern analysis confirmed positive habitat connectivity trends: the delineation of fringe areas has preserved, in energy crops scenario, natural and semi-natural classes, reducing the risk of disturbance with respect to the biodiversity and habitat. This condition assumes that adopted S-MCDA method can contribute positively and significantly to the definition of LUC scenarios and land management. In conclusion, marginal lands can become an opportunity to improve socio-economic conditions and to enhance land image, while respecting the environment. LUC scenarios building, and their assessment by means of ecological indicators become a dynamic and structured tool in the land use planning /management process to support decision maker choices and to re-calibrate interventions, with the aim of contributing to sustainable policies of land management (ecological corridors, compensation and / or mitigation measures, etc.), emphasizing land sustainable management benefits (such as climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
Resilient storm pipes: a multi-stage decision support system,"North America’s infrastructure, in general, and stormwater system, as a crucial component of our urban infrastructure, are in dire condition states that require attention and, in some cases, urgent intervention. According to the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE), the stormwater system received a condition state “D+”. Even though existing management systems for storm pipes optimize the timing of maintenance and replacement aiming at improving the overall storm pipes’ network condition, they ignored the effect of urban growth and climate change (i.e. intense and frequent rainfall cause flooding) on the pipes’ deterioration. Thus, this paper presents a scheduling decision-making framework that opts at optimizing the pipes’ replacement decisions to increase their resiliency while considering the annual expenditures, urban growth and its’ future impact on the demand. To demonstrate the system’s functionality, it was deployed on the storm pipes of Kindersley in Saskatchewan, Canada. The results showed that $300,000 a year was enough to meet the city’s condition and flow demand–capacity goals, enhance their average condition from 33% to 63% and drop the flow demand–capacity to 64%. Furthermore, replacements’ breakdown analysis indicated that longer analysis periods enhance the system’s capability in capturing the long-term impact of the decisions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
Stochastic optimal control methodologies in risk-informed community resilience planning,"The absorptive and restorative abilities of a community are two key elements of community resilience following disasters. The recovery of communities relies on an efficient restoration planning of damaged critical infrastructure systems, household units, and impaired supporting social and economic functions. These interdependent systems form a dynamic system of systems that changes continuously during restoration. Therefore, an effective and practical recovery planning process for a community can be modeled as a sequential dynamic optimization problem under uncertainty. This paper seeks to enhance our understanding of dynamic optimization concepts and their role in formulating post-disaster, community-level recovery strategies. Various methods of classic dynamic programming and reinforcement learning are examined and applied. Simulation-based approximate dynamic programming techniques are introduced to overcome the curse of dimensionality, which is characteristic of large-scale and multi-state systems of systems. The paper aims not only to study the unexplored topic of dynamic optimization in community resilience, but also to be a practical reference for policymakers, practitioners, engineers, and operations analysts to harness the power of dynamic optimization toward assessing and achieving community resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
Spatial heterogeneities of current and future hurricane flood risk along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts,"We evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of hurricane flood risk along the United States (U.S.) Atlantic and Gulf coasts under two different climate scenarios (current and future). The flood hazard is presented as the hurricane surge flood level with 1% annual exceedance probability (100-year flood) under the two scenarios, where the future scenario considers the effect of hurricane climatology change and sea level rise towards late-21st-century under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). This hazard information is combined with estimated vulnerability and disaster resilience of coastal communities to map the relative current and future risk employing different risk definitions. Several geographical techniques and spatial distributional models (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, spatial hotspot analysis, and spatial multivariate clustering analysis) are applied to systematically analyze the risk and identify statistically significant hotspots of the highest risk. Most of the high-risk hotspots are found in the Gulf coast region, particularly along the west coast of Florida. However, two out of three risk evaluation approaches also indicate New York City as a risk hotspot under the future climate—showing that the resultant risk is sensitive to the consideration of evaluation factors (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and resilience). Additionally, we apply a machine-learning algorithm-based spatial multivariate approach to map the spatially distinct groups based on the values of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and resilience. The results show that the counties in the highest risk group (value >3rd quartile, 15% of total counties, including New York City) in the future lack specifically in the community capital and the social components of community resilience. This assessment of coastal risk to hurricane flood has important policy-relevant implications to provide a focus-for-action for risk reduction and resilience enhancement for the U.S., where 6.5 million households live in the hurricane flood-prone areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
Agroecological food web modelling to evaluate and design organic and conventional agricultural systems,"The question of whether organic or conventional agriculture is most suitable for meeting world food requirements and improving resilience to climate change is the topic of much current research. Most comparisons, however, focus either on output efficiency such as yields or on impacts of different nutrient management strategies on the sustainability of the agrosystems, and the impacts of each on the agricultural food webs and beneficial insects responsible for pest control – or outbreaks – has been often overlooked. While standard cropping models can explain if, why and how organic nutrient and crop management work and how they should be adapted to climate change, the lack of mechanistic models of agroecology prevents us from explaining why and how passive and active biocontrol and integrated pest management function, when they do not function, and what optimal management strategies could be employed. In this research, we show that agroecological food web models calibrated with field population dynamics data can be used to demonstrate the mechanisms behind food web dynamics that have been previously observed in the field. Results of scenario simulations show that chemical control provides immediate relief from pest pressures, but at high risk of later pest resurgence if control is not repeated; on the contrary, biological control requires more time to reduce pest populations to acceptable levels but with minimal risk of causing resurgence. In all cases, success of pest control measures is highly dependent on the date of action. In addition, the use of modelling tools to optimise biological control application dates led to much better control than either fixed date or pest population threshold-based applications. These analyses and resulting integrated pest management intervention recommendations are only possible with agroecological food web population dynamics models. We encourage future studies to examine more complex food webs from a variety of agroecosystems to test whether functional responses differ significantly, and hope that this approach will succeed in bringing agroecological food web predictive modelling to the level where it can routinely be used as a decision-making support tool, as hydrological and crop models are employed today. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
Flash-flood hazard assessment using ensembles and Bayesian-based machine learning models: Application of the simulated annealing feature selection method,"Flash-floods are increasingly recognized as a frequent natural hazard worldwide. Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90–92%, Kappa = 79–84%, Success ratio = 94–96%, Threat score = 80–84%, and Heidke skill score = 79–84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
Assessing and visualising hazard impacts to enhance the resilience of Critical Infrastructures to urban flooding,"The design, construction and maintenance of Critical Infrastructures (CI) is commonly based on standards that are rigorous, so as to withstand any climate or weather-linked pressures. However, due to climate change, climate characteristics may shift, resulting in increased frequency/magnitude of potential failures, or exposure to new unknown risks. As vital components for the normal functioning of modern societies, the resilience of CIs under climate stressors encompasses their structural integrity, their operational elements, and their capacity to maximize business output. In this work, we propose an integrated and participatory methodological approach to enhance the resilience of interconnected CIs to urban flooding under climate change, by assessing the risk and introducing adaptation measures. The main objectives of the proposed methodology and approach are: (i) to provide scientific evidence for better understanding of how future climate regimes might affect normal operation of interconnected CI in urban areas during their lifespan; (ii) to assess the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation measures; (iii) to involve local stakeholders and operators in the co-design of the approach, as well as the assessment and the evaluation of adaptation measures; (iv) to combine computational modelling with advanced 3D visualisation techniques for effectively engaging stakeholders in decision making; (v) to include risk assessment and damage functions co-designed by end-users and local stakeholders; (vi) to integrate all of the aforementioned components in a specifically designed cloud platform as a Decision Support System for end-users, (vii) to validate the DSS by the end users and local stakeholders. The paper presents the computational background and tools. Additionally, it describes a Case Study in Torbay, UK, where the full methodology and the proposed participatory approach have been applied, with all the specifics, i.e., the scenarios of extreme flooding, the numerical and visualisation results, the response of the stakeholders and the evaluation of selected adaptation measures. © 2019"
Decision support systems for agriculture 4.0: Survey and challenges,"Undoubtedly, high demands for food from the world-wide growing population are impacting the environment and putting many pressures on agricultural productivity. Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research. © 2020 The Authors"
"Machine learning to evaluate impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh, 1983-2014","Impacts of climate change adaptation strategies need to be evaluated using principled methods spanning sectors and longer time frames. We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection. This has implications for Bangladesh's planning for future and more extreme climate futures, including the national Delta Plan, and global investments in climate resilient infrastructure to create positive social impacts. © 2020 by the authors."
Evaluation of Adaptation Scenarios for Climate Change Impacts on Agricultural Water Allocation Using Fuzzy MCDM Methods,"Due to the impacts of climate change on agriculture and water allocation, an investigation of the farmers’ perceptions and stakeholders’ views on the adaptation strategies to climate change has a great of importance for sustainable development in the future. In this study, a fuzzy based decision support system has been developed to evaluate and rank the proposed adaptation scenarios to climate change in the Jarreh agricultural water resources system in southwest of Iran. Using output of ten coupled models inter comparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5), the results indicated an increasing the annual mean temperature (1.64–1.84 °C under RCP 4.5, and 1.85–2.1 °C under RCP 8.5), reducing the amount of runoff into the reservoir (17.83–46.24% under RCP 4.5, and 21.54–50.91%under RCP 8.5), as well as increasing the amount of agricultural water requirement. Also, the results showed decreasing in reliability of system (12–53% under RCP 4.5, and 23–63% under RCP 8.5). Following, due to the main purpose of the system, six adaptation scenarios by using a questionnaire and stakeholders’ opinions are proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change. In the next step, by fuzzy mode of the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE II), the proposed scenarios have been ranked according to the performance criteria. The final results of this study indicated the superiority of improving the irrigation efficiency and decreasing the area under cultivation among other proposed scenarios. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."
Machine learning approaches for spatial modeling of agricultural droughts in the south-east region of Queensland Australia,"A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans. Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994–2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
Resilience Analysis of Urban Road Networks Based on Adaptive Signal Controls: Day-to-Day Traffic Dynamics with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Improving the resilience of urban road networks suffering from various disruptions has been a central focus for urban emergence management. However, to date the effective methods which may mitigate the negative impacts caused by the disruptions, such as road accidents and natural disasters, on urban road networks is highly insufficient. This study proposes a novel adaptive signal control strategy based on a doubly dynamic learning framework, which consists of deep reinforcement learning and day-to-day traffic dynamic learning, to improve the network performance by adjusting red/green time split. In this study, red time split is regarded as extra traffic flow to discourage drivers to use affected roads, so as to reduce congestion and improve the resilience when urban road networks are subject to different levels of disruptions. In addition, we utilize the convolution neural network as Q-network to approximate Q values, link flow distribution and link capacity are regarded as the state space, and actions are denoted as red/green time split. A small network is utilized as a numerical example, and a fixed time signal control and other two adaptive signal controls are employed for the comparisons with the proposed one. The results show that the proposed adaptive signal control based on deep reinforcement learning can achieve better resilience in most of the cases, particularly in the scenarios of moderate and severe disruptions. This study may shed light on the advantages of the proposed adaptive signal control dealing with major emergencies compared to others. © 2020 Wen-Long Shang et al."
Predicting human mobility during natural disasters: A deep learning approach,"There has been an increasing body of research utilizing human trajectory data to capture and analyze human movements. Previous studies demonstrated inherent transition regularities of human mobility with potential high predictability. However, we still have very limited understanding of how the predictability could change under the influence of natural disasters. In this study, we utilize mobility dataset with ample sample size and high resolution under catastrophic events to quantify their disruption on human mobility. We develop a framework adopting information theory metrics and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based predictive model to collectively quantify the perturbation effect on human mobility during Hurricane Irma. Moreover, we associate such effect with the evacuation behavior and investigate the heterogeneity of individuals. Despite observing a universally instant spatial constraint for all individuals, we found that the evacuees were able to withstand their spatial-temporal patterns with higher resilience compared to non-evacuees. We also show that the displacement distance was not significantly correlated with predictability change, hinting that additional economical and sociodemographic factors should be considered to understand the mobility recovery pattern more thoroughly. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."
Predicting Road Network Vulnerability to Fluvial Flooding Using Machine Learning Classifiers: Case Study of Houston during Hurricane Harvey,"The objective of this study is to identify vulnerable sections in the transportation network with the help of machine learning classifiers. Many network-theory based frameworks have been proposed to assess the vulnerability of transportation networks using network centrality based measures; however, those measures can not be directly translated into the actual vulnerability of transportation networks as many studies seem to proclaim. This is because vulnerability is not only about the failure consequence but also failure probability, and there are clear heterogeneities in disaster-exposure levels of the individual nodes due to the spatially embedded nature of transportation networks. It is possible to study and characterize this heterogeneity with the help of classification tools in machine learning. First, the road network at a super neighborhood level is modeled as a primal graph. Then, a new measure for flood exposure of the nodes in a road network was proposed and treated as the dependent variable. Two independent variables, namely elevation and the shortest distance from flood control infrastructure, were identified for each individual node. A classification algorithm was trained and tested in order to predict the flood exposure of individual nodes in the road network. In the end, connectivity of the road network was estimated after removing nodes (which are predicted using the best performing classification algorithm) that are particularly vulnerable to fluvial flooding. The results indicated that the K-means clustering algorithm had the highest prediction accuracy. The proposed methodology was then applied to assess the vulnerability of other super neighborhoods in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. The proposed framework expands the scope of traditional vulnerability assessment analysis for the road networks by effectively making use of machine learning tools, as well as publicly available data. Results from this study could be used to inform resilience enhancement decisions. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."
"Ensemble models of GLM, FDA, MARS, and RF for flood and erosion susceptibility mapping: a priority assessment of sub-basins","The mountainous watersheds are increasingly challenged with extreme erosions and devastating floods due to climate change and human interventions. Hazard mapping is essential for local policymaking for prevention, planning the mitigation actions, and also adaptation to extremes. This study proposes novel predictive models for susceptibility mapping for flood and erosion. Furthermore, this study elaborates on prioritizing the existing sub-basins in terms of erosion and flood susceptibility. A comparative analysis of generalized linear model (GLM), flexible discriminate analyses (FDA), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), random forest (RF), and their ensemble is performed to ensure highest predictive performance. Furthermore, the priority of the sub-basins in terms of sensitivity to erosion and flood was determined based on the best model. The results showed that the GLM, FDA, MARS, RF, and ensemble models had an area under curve (AUC) 0.91, 0.92, 0.89, 0.93 and 0.94, respectively, in modeling the flood susceptibility. Also, the GLM, FDA, MARS, RF, and ensemble models had an AUC of 0.93, 0.92, 0.89, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively, in determining erosion susceptibility. Priority assessment based on the best model, the ensemble approach, indicated that the sub-basins SW3 and SW5 were found to have high sensitivity to the flood and soil erosion, respectively. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
Optimizing the Post-Disaster Control of Islanded Microgrid: A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Extreme disasters may cause the power supply to the distribution system (DS) to be interrupted. The DS is forced to operate in island mode and forms an islanded microgrid (MG). In order to improve the post-disaster resilience of the DS and to provide longer power supply for as many loads as possible with limited generation resources, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method which realizes a dual control on the source and load sides of the MG. The problem of resilience improvement is converted to a sequential decision making problem, where the objective is to maximize the cumulative MG utility value over the power outage duration. A multi-agent DRL model is proposed to solve the sequential decision making problem. A dual control policy including energy storage management and load shedding strategy is put forward to maximize the utility value of the MG. A reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on OpenAI and OpenDSS for islanded MG is constructed as a simulator, which has a general interface compatible with, and also can be published to, OpenAI Gym. Numerical simulations are performed for an MG equipped with wind turbines, diesel generators, and storage devices to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The influences of available generation resources and power outage duration on the control policy are discussed, which validates the strong adaptability of the proposed method in different conditions. © 2013 IEEE."
Tracking Flooding Phase Transitions and Establishing a Passive Hotline with AI-Enabled Social Media Data,"Flooding management requires collecting real-time onsite information widely and rapidly. As an emerging data source, social media demonstrates an advantage of providing in-time, rich data in the format of texts and photos and can be used to improve flooding situation awareness. The present study shows that social media data, with additional information processed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, can be effectively used to track flooding phase transition and locate emergency incidents. To track phase transition, we train a computer vision model that can classify images embedded in social media data into four categories-preparedness, impact, response, and recovery-that can reflect the phases of disaster event development. To locate emergency incidents, we use a deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) model to recognize locations from textual content of tweets. The geographic coordinates of the recognized locations are assigned by searching through a dedicated local gazetteer rapidly compiled for the disaster affected region based on the GeoNames gazetteer and the US Census data. By combining image and text analysis, we filter the tweets that contain images of the 'Impact' category and high-resolution locations to gain the most valuable situation information. We carry out a manual examination step to complement the automatic data processing and find that it can further strengthen the AI-processed results to support comprehensive situation awareness and to establish a passive hotline to inform rescue and search activities. The developed framework is applied to the flood of Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area. © 2020 IEEE."
Aligning Discriminative and Representative Features: An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Building Damage Assessment,"Building assessment is highly prioritized during rescue operations and damage relief after hurricane disasters. Although machine learning has made remarkable improvement in building damage classification, it remains challenging because classifiers must be trained using a massive amount of labeled data. Furthermore, data labeling is labor intensive, costly, and unavailable after a disaster. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method with aligned discriminative and representative features (ADRF), which leverage a substantial amount of labeled data of relevant disaster scenes for new classification tasks. The remote sensing imageries of different disasters are collected using different sensors, viewpoints, times, even at various places. Compared with the public datasets used in the domain adaptation community, the remote sensing imageries are more complicated which exhibit characteristics of lower discrimination between categories and higher diversity within categories. As a result, pursuing domain invariance is a huge challenge. To achieve this goal, we build a framework with ADRF to improve the discriminative and representative capability of the extracted features to facilitate the classification task. The ADRF framework consists of three pipelines: a classifier for the labeled data of the source domain and one autoencoder each for the source and target domains. The latent variables of autoencoders are forced to observe unit Gaussian distributions by minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), whereas the marginal distributions of both domains are aligned via the MMD. As a case study, two challenging transfer tasks using the hurricane Sandy, Maria, and Irma datasets are investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that ADRF achieves overall accuracy of 71.6% and 84.1% in the transfer tasks from dataset Sandy to dataset Maria and dataset Irma, respectively. © 1992-2012 IEEE."
Agent-based model application for resource management analysis,"Due to climate change and population growth, the agriculture sector has been faced with two challenges; securing water and food and transferring into sustainable resource management. To systematize resource management which currently mainly relies on farmers’ experience, digital technologies have been developed. Considering current tighter resource availability, it is desirable to examine resource management behavior of beneficiaries using scarce resources to analyze resilience and adaptability of institutions. In this study, we analyzed factors of water use behavior of Water Users Associations (WUAs) to solve water allocation problem with Agent-Based Model (ABM). The simulation results show that factors of water use behavior were water resources and the existence of different water use laws, and downstream WUAs developed adaptation methods. To enhance sustainable resource management, ABM can be applied to analyze factors and their rules and/or laws to understand what enhances resilience and adaptability of institutions.

Modeling climate change impact on wind power resources using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,"Climate change impacts and adaptations are ongoing issues that are attracting the attention of many researchers. Insight into the wind power potential in an area and its probable variation due to climate change impacts can provide useful information for energy policymakers and strategists for sustainable development and management of the energy. In this study, spatial variation of wind power density at the turbine hub-height and its variability under future climatic scenarios are taken into consideration. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based post-processing technique was used to match the power outputs of the regional climate model (RCM) with those obtained from reference data. The near-surface wind data obtained from an RCM were used to investigate climate change impacts on the wind power resources in the Caspian Sea. After converting near-surface wind speed to turbine hub-height speed and computation of wind power density, the results were investigated to reveal mean annual power, seasonal and monthly variability for 20 year historical (1981–2000) and future (2081–2100) periods. The results revealed that climate change does not notably affect the wind climate over the study area. However, a small decrease was projected in the future simulation, revealing a slight decrease in mean annual wind power in the future compared to historical simulations. Moreover, the results demonstrated strong variation in wind power in terms of temporal and spatial distribution, with winter and summer having the highest values. The results indicate that the middle and northern parts of the Caspian Sea have the highest values of wind power. However, the results of the post-processing technique using the ANFIS model showed that the real potential of wind power in the area is lower than that projected in the RCM. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

PN Inference Based Autonomous Sequential Restoration of Distribution System Under Natural Disaster,"Potential challenge during a disaster is the wide range of disturbance caused to the power system network. The article attempts to develop a systematic procedure to progressively restore the network by recognizing the alive network. During disaster there is manpower shortage and poor road connectivity around the affected area. Hence, an autonomous priority-based restoration policy is required for critical load restoration. The main idea of the proposed article is to develop an autonomous system, which is decision-based restoration system by identifying the network component still available after disaster followed by reconfiguration confirming the proposed load pickup procedure. Because of the inherent capability of implementing the condition-based state transition of switches and parallel processing, a petri net (PN) based methodology has been used in the article to integrate alive parts, which further assists in identifying the best switching schedule of circuit breakers for autonomous load restoration. The primary contribution of the article is to develop an encapsulated algorithm using PN as a modeling platform of components as well as empowering the same by introducing the game-theory-based concept in the formulation of different microgrids integrated with distributed generators during extreme weather events. The verification of effective autonomous restoration is then realized by using the available delivery capability and design verification of the framed microgrids, and the comparison with different restoration strategies adopted by other authors. The studies are carried out with the IEEE 34, 37, and 123-bus feeder test systems for implementation and validation of the proposed article along with the comparison with other published works."
Improving disasters preparedness and response for coastal communities using AIS ship tracking data,"Many coastal communities are heavily dependent on maritime transportation for the ingress and egress of people and goods. Any major transportation disruption can have a significant negative impact on the safety, health and wellbeing of affected communities, this is due to the interruption in the availability of food and the supply medicines and fuel. Therefore, preparedness and the forward planning of an effective response are essential for successful emergency and recovery management. Accordingly, in this study, the concept of using AIS (Automatic Identification System) vessel tracking data has been applied for the study of disaster management in coastal communities. The AIS vessel tracking system has been an important development in navigational safety; this is because it continuously transmits important information to all other vessels about a particular vessel (including its position, identity, speed and route). One of the limitations of the AIS tracking system is that AIS data does not indicate commodity specifications: that is, the quantity of essential goods that each vessel is carrying to specified coastal communities. To overcome the limitation of the current AIS tracking system, we use an artificial neural network as an estimation tool. In the current study, AIS data are assessed and analyzed in addition to the augmentation of the capacity information of vessels; thus, the study develops a predictive model so that a relief manager can determine the actual needs of affected residents and thus be able to make responsible relief decisions (e.g., how much relief a disaster-affected community is likely to need). The study makes a unique contribution as its focus seeks to remedy the total lack of research on how to use AIS data in disaster operations."
Social media data and housing recovery following extreme natural hazards,"Identifying initiatives that influence the decision-making process of individuals in the aftermath of extreme natural events is a critical task in post-disaster recovery research. Due to the diversity of disaster-induced physical and psychosocial damage, as well as the complexity of human behavior, a comprehensive under standing of contributing factors requires a collective effort. The growth of social media platforms with millions of users provides researchers with an exceptional opportunity to conceptualize spatial patterns and communal behaviors. This longitudinal study proposes a multistep machine learning algorithm to understand such recovery decisions using social media data. Two publicly available databases, New York City tax lot data and 109 million geotagged tweets from the period October 2012-October 2014 were used to explore residents' recovery decisions in the two years following Hurricane Sandy. The results reveal that communities with more tweets about social interactions and fewer tweets related to infrastructure and assets were more likely to rebuild rather than relocate."
Perceived neighborhood: Preferences versus actualities,"Housing recovery plays a key role in the overall restoration of a community. A multitude of factors affect housing recovery, many of which are associated with interactions of residents with their perceived neighborhoods. Targeting perceived neighborhoods rather than administratively defined measures of land helps with devising recovery plans that could better address social preferences of the residents. However, such measures are commonly subject to collection of information via expensive and time-consuming surveys. The current research aims to contribute to the domain by exploring the relationship between perception of households of their neighborhood anchors (perceived anchors) and the anchors that exist within perceived neighborhood boundaries (actual anchors). The goal is to propose a model for classifying households' perceived anchors from publicly available data on actual anchors. Data were collected on households' attributes, perceived neighborhood boundaries, and perceived community anchors through an online survey of New York and Louisiana residents. Actual anchors were mined from the OpenStreetMap database. Correlation analysis revealed several significant associations between actual and perceived anchors. A multilayer feed-forward neural network model was also developed to predict the classification of households' perceived anchors from actual anchors. Sensitivity analysis of the model disclosed that individuals whose perceived neighborhood comprised more categories of actual anchors were more likely to prioritize infrastructure to other neighborhood assets, a preference that was more dominant in high-density areas."
Assessing climate-induced agricultural vulnerable coastal communities of Bangladesh using machine learning techniques,"The agricultural arena in the coastal regions of South-East Asian countries is experiencing the mounting pressures of the adverse effects of climate change. Controlling and predicting climatic factors are difficult and require expensive solutions. The study focuses on identifying issues other than climatic factors using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to measure agricultural vulnerability. Factors such as monthly savings of the farmers, income opportunities, damage to cultivable lands, and water availability had significant impacts on increasing community vulnerability with regards to agricultural practice. The study also identified the need for assessing vulnerability after certain intervals, specifically owing to the dynamic nature of the coastal region where the factors were found to vary among the different study areas. The development of a climate-resilient livelihood vulnerability assessment tool to detect the most significant factors to assess agricultural vulnerability was done using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML techniques identified nine significant factors out of 21 based on the minimum level of standard deviation (0.03). A practical application of the outcome of the study was the development of a mobile application. Custom REST APIs (application programming interface) were developed on the backend to seamlessly sync the app to a server, thus ensuring the acquisition of future data without much effort and resources. The paper provides a methodology for a unique vulnerability assessment technique using a mobile application, which can be used for the planning and management of resources by different stakeholders in a sustainable way.

Development of micro-level classifiers from land suitability analysis for drought-prone areas in Indonesia,"Climatic and environmental changes significantly influence the suitability of land for sustainable staple crop production around the world. Under climate change, droughts become severe due to the lack of precipitation, and food insecurity exists in many developing countries. Indonesia has been facing the challenges of climate change, especially in mitigating the effects of drought, and it is essential to select land that is suitable for microlevel crop production. Therefore, the aim of this research was to classify the suitable lands in drought-prone areas of central East Java of Indonesia. GIS and satellite remote sensing datasets have been used to develop a land suitability analysis based on the FAO classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was incorporated with expert opinion using factors and constraints, which influenced the land suitability assessments. The integrated AHP and the land suitability analysis inferred that 40.26 per cent of the study area was classified as highly suitable, 30.82 per cent were moderately suitable, and 21.89 per cent were marginally suitable for Maize Cultivation in central East Java. At the microlevel, the suitable land were further divided using a random forest classifier with high-dimensional classification features to increase the computational efficiency using k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms. The experimental results of this algorithm could effectively search the nearest classifier to increase the algorithm efficiency. This research recommends extending the machine learning approach with remote sensing and GIS to select suitable land for maize production at the microlevels in drought-prone areas."
"The role of beliefs, expectations and values in decision-making favoring climate change adaptation-implications for communications with European forest professionals","Beliefs, expectations and values are often assumed to drive decisions about climate change adaptation. We tested hypotheses based on this assumption using survey responses from 508 European forest professionals in ten countries. We used the survey results to identify communication needs and the decision strategies at play, and to develop guidelines on adequate communications about climate change adaptation. We observed polarization in the positive and negative values associated with climate change impacts accepted by survey respondents. We identified a mechanism creating the polarization that we call the 'blocked belief' effect. We found that polarized values did not correlate with decisions about climate change adaptation. Strong belief in the local impacts of climate change on the forest was, however, a prerequisite of decision-making favoring adaptation. Decision-making in favor of adaptation to climate change also correlated with net values of expected specific impacts on the forest and generally increased with the absolute value of these in the absence of 'tipping point' behavior. Tipping point behavior occurs when adaptation is not pursued in spite of the strongly negative or positive net value of expected climate change impacts. We observed negative and positive tipping point behavior, mainly in SW Europe and N-NE Europe, respectively. In addition we found that advice on effective adaptation may inhibit adaptation when the receiver is aware of effective adaptation measures unless it is balanced with information explaining how climate change leads to negative impacts. Forest professionals with weak expectations of impacts require communications on climate change and its impacts on forests before any advice on adaptation measures can be effective. We develop evidence-based guidelines on communications using a new methodology which includes Bayesian machine learning modeling of the equivalent of an expected utility function for the adaptation decision problem."
Impact of extreme weather conditions on European crop production in 2018,"Extreme weather increases the risk of large-scale crop failure. The mechanisms involved are complex and intertwined, hence undermining the identification of simple adaptation levers to help improve the resilience of agricultural production. Based on more than 82 000 yield data reported at the regional level in 17 European countries, we assess how climate affected the yields of nine crop species. Using machine learning models, we analyzed historical yield data since 1901 and then focus on 2018, which has experienced a multiplicity and a diversity of atypical extreme climatic conditions. Machine learning models explain up to 65% of historical yield anomalies. We find that both extremes in temperature and precipitation are associated with negative yield anomalies, but with varying impacts in different parts of Europe. In 2018, Northern and Eastern Europe experienced multiple and simultaneous crop failures-among the highest observed in recent decades. These yield losses were associated with extremely low rainfalls in combination with high temperatures between March and August 2018. However, the higher than usual yields recorded in Southern Europe-caused by favourable spring rainfall conditions-nearly offset the large decrease in Northern European crop production. Our results outline the importance of considering single and compound climate extremes to analyse the causes of yield losses in Europe. We found no clear upward or downward trend in the frequency of extreme yield losses for any of the considered crops between 1990 and 2018. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'."
Machine Learning for Conservation Planning in a Changing Climate,"Wildlife species' habitats throughout North America are subject to direct and indirect consequences of climate change. Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2 degrees C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others."
Detecting early warning signals of long-term water supply vulnerability using machine learning,"Adapting water resources systems to climate change requires identifying hydroclimatic signals that reliably indicate long-term transitions to vulnerable system states. While recent studies have classified the conditions under which vulnerability occurs (i.e., scenario discovery), there remains an opportunity to extend such methods into a dynamic planning context to design and assess early warning signals. This study contributes a machine learning approach to classifying the occurrence of long-term water supply vulnerability over lead times ranging from 0 to 20 years, using a case study of the northern California reservoir system. Results indicate that this approach predicts the occurrence of future vulnerabilities in validation significantly better than a random classifier, given a balanced set of training data. Accuracy decreases at longer lead times, and the most influential predictors include long-term monthly averages of reservoir storage. Dynamic early warning signals can be used to inform monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities under a changing climate."
Spatial heterogeneities of current and future hurricane flood risk along the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts,"We evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of hurricane flood risk along the United States (US.) Atlantic and Gulf coasts under two different climate scenarios (current and future). The flood hazard is presented as the hurricane surge flood level with 1% annual exceedance probability (100-year flood) under the two scenarios, where the future scenario considers the effect of hurricane climatology change and sea level rise towards late-21st-century under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). This hazard information is combined with estimated vulnerability and disaster resilience of coastal communities to map the relative current and future risk employing different risk definitions. Several geographical techniques and spatial distributional models (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, spatial hotspot analysis, and spatial multivariate clustering analysis) are applied to systematically analyze the risk and identify statistically significant hotspots of the highest risk. Most of the high-risk hotspots are found in the Gulf coast region, particularly along the west coast of Florida. However, two out of three risk evaluation approaches also indicate New York City as a risk hotspot under the future climate-showing that the resultant risk is sensitive to the consideration of evaluation factors (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and resilience). Additionally, we apply a machine-learning algorithm-based spatial multivariate approach to map the spatially distinct groups based on the values of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and resilience. The results show that the counties in the highest risk group (value >3rd quartile, 15% of total counties, including New York City) in the future lack specifically in the community capital and the social components of community resilience. This assessment of coastal risk to hurricane flood has important policy-relevant implications to provide a focus-for-action for risk reduction and resilience enhancement for the US., where 6.5 million households live in the hurricane flood-prone areas.

Urban flood risk mapping using data-driven geospatial techniques for a flood-prone case area in Iran,"In an effort to improve tools for effective flood risk assessment, we applied machine learning algorithms to predict flood-prone areas in Amol city (Iran), a site with recent floods (2017-2018). An ensemble approach was then implemented to predict hazard probabilities using the best machine learning algorithms (boosted regression tree, multivariate adaptive regression spline, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model) based on a receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) assessment. The algorithms were all trained and tested on 92 randomly selected points, information from a flood inundation survey, and geospatial predictor variables (precipitation, land use, elevation, slope percent, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, and depth to groundwater). The ensemble model had 0.925 and 0.892 accuracy for training and testing data, respectively. We then created a vulnerability map from data on building density, building age, population density, and socio-economic conditions and assessed risk as a product of hazard and vulnerability. The results indicated that distance to channel, land use, and runoff generation were the most important factors associated with flood hazard, while population density and building density were the most important factors determining vulnerability. Areas of highest and lowest flood risks were identified, leading to recommendations on where to implement flood risk reduction measures to guide flood governance in Amol city."
Learning a Planning Domain Model From Natural Language Process Manuals,"Artificial intelligence planning techniques have been widely used in many applications. A big challenge is to automate a planning model, especially for planning applications based on natural language (NL) input. This requires the analysis and understanding of NL text and a general learning technique does not exist in real-world applications. In this article, we investigate an intelligent planning technique for natural disaster management, e.g. typhoon contingency plan generation, through natural language process manuals. A planning model is to optimise management operations when a disaster occurs in a short time. Instead of manually building the planning model, we aim to automate the planning model generation by extracting disaster management-related content through NL processing (NLP) techniques. The learning input comes from the published documents that describe the operational process of preventing potential loss in the typhoon management. We adopt a classical planning model, namely planning domain definition language (PDDL), in the typhoon contingency plan generation. We propose a novel framework of FPTCP, which stands for a Framework of Planning Typhoon Contingency Plan, for learning a domain model of PDDL from NL text. We adapt NLP techniques to construct a ternary template of sentences of NL inputs from which actions and their objects are extracted to build a domain model. We also develop a comprehensive suite of user interaction components and facilitate the involvement of users in order to improve the learned domain models. The user interaction is to remove semantic duplicates of NL objects such that the users can select model-generated actions and predicates to better fit the PDDL domain model. We detail the implementation steps of the proposed FPTCP and evaluate its performance on real-world typhoon datasets. In addition, we compare FPTCP with two state-of-the-art approaches in applications of narrative generation, and discuss its capability and limitations."
"A Machine Learning Ensemble Approach Based on Random Forest and Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Risk Evaluation of Regional Flood Disaster: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Delta, China","The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the most developed regions in China. This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the people-land nexus and the people-water nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing the urban flood risk in the YRD region were proposed, in order to provide decision support for flood control, disaster reduction and emergency management in the YRD region."
Predicting global patterns of long-term climate change from short-term simulations using machine learning,"Understanding and estimating regional climate change under different anthropogenic emission scenarios is pivotal for informing societal adaptation and mitigation measures. However, the high computational complexity of state-of-the-art climate models remains a central bottleneck in this endeavour. Here we introduce a machine learning approach, which utilises a unique dataset of existing climate model simulations to learn relationships between short-term and long-term temperature responses to different climate forcing scenarios. This approach not only has the potential to accelerate climate change projections by reducing the costs of scenario computations, but also helps uncover early indicators of modelled long-term climate responses, which is of relevance to climate change detection, predictability, and attribution. Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future. We therefore encourage extensive data sharing among research institutes to build ever more powerful climate response emulators, and thus to enable faster climate change projections. © 2020, CROWN."
SEGMENTATION OF 3D POINT CLOUDS DATA TO ANALYZE ENVIRONMENTAL ADAPTATIONS IN SORGHUM,"Annotation: Climate change and varied precipitation patterns are threatening the sustainability of food production in India. Our challenge is to develop novel technologies that allow crop production to be observed or analyzed in the face of declining water availability. International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT) is one of the leading institutes that pave the way for further progress in this area by using up-to-date technologies. The imaging platform they use produces the opportunity for analyzing critical features for drought adaptation and harnesses crop genetics for the breeding of improved varieties. This study introduces the software tool which facilitates the analysis of the 3D point clouds data collected by the ICRISAT. Thanks to the software tool developed, the 3D crop data segments from the tray, soil and the noise data. When the outputs are examined in detail, it is clearly seen that the separation process has been carried out successfully. Thus, the first step to produce more consistent data analysis results by using state of art machine learning algorithms has been fulfilled."
Incorporating machine learning with biophysical model can improve the evaluation of climate extremes impacts on wheat yield in south-eastern Australia,"Accurately assessing the impacts of extreme climate events (ECEs) on crop yield can help develop effective agronomic practices to deal with climate change impacts. Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress) into the Random Forest (RF) model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1–10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield."
"Landslides-oriented urban disaster resilience assessment - A case study in ShenZhen, China","With the increasing expansion of cities associated with rapid urbanization, the ecological environment is being severely damaged, exposing cities to frequent extreme weather events. Urban ecological ecosystems are under great threat. Research on urban disaster resilience is conducive to a better understanding of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, and provides valuable references for resilient city construction. In this study, a typical city under rapid urbanization in China - Shenzhen - was chosen as the research area, including the city's 57 sub-districts. Urban disaster resilience to rainfall-induced landslides was conceptually framed into the dimensions of physical resilience and social resilience. Support vector machine (SVM) was applied to evaluate the physical resilience and a Delphi-analytic hierarchy process (Delphi-AHP) model was used to assess social resilience on a sub-district scale in 2016. The results show that the physical resilience and social resilience of Shenzhen demonstrate obvious spatial concentration trends. Areas with low physical resilience were located in sub-districts of Dapeng New District with intense rainfall and complex topography, as well as those in Guangming New District with lateritic red earth derived from arenaceous shale. Areas with low social resilience were mainly located in eastern Shenzhen, including sub-districts in Longgang District and Dapeng New District, with undeveloped economy, inadequate infrastructures and many vulnerable people. All sub-districts in the three districts of Pingshan New District, Dapeng New District and Guangming New District need attention because of their low comprehensive resilience. Comparison of the physical resilience and social resilience indicated that the performance of physical resilience was significantly better than that of social resilience; only 26% of the sub-districts of Shenzhen had a higher level of social resilience than of physical resilience. Therefore, the government should strengthen urban management of social services and physical infrastructure provision to improve social resilience to cope with urban disasters."
Assessment of urban flood susceptibility using semi-supervised machine learning model,"In order to identify flood-prone areas with limited flood inventories, a semi-supervised machine learning model—the weakly labeled support vector machine (WELLSVM)—is used to assess urban flood susceptibility in this study. A spatial database is collected from metropolitan areas in Beijing, including flood inventories from 2004 to 2014 and nine metrological, geographical, and anthropogenic explanatory factors. Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management."
5D World Map System for Disaster-Resilience Monitoring from Global to Local: Environmental AI System for Leading SDG 9 and 11,"This paper presents a 5D World Map System's application for disasterresilience monitoring as ""Environmental AI System"" of each player's implementation of United Nation's SDG 9 and DGS 11 from global-level to regional-level, country-level, sub-regional-level and city-level. In Asia-Pacific, disaster risk is outpacing disaster resilience. The gap between risk and resiliencebuilding is growing in those countries with the least capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters. Using the Sensing-Processing-Actuation (SPA) functions of 5D World Map System, a disaster risk analysis can be conducted in multiple contexts, including regional, national, and sub-national. At the regional, national and subnational levels, the analysis will focus on identifying disaster risk hotspots through incorporating existing multi-hazard disaster risk and socio-economic risk information. The system will further be used to assess future risks through integration of global climate scenarios downscaled to the region as well as countries. This paper presents the design of two new actuation functions of 5D World Map System: (1) Short-term warning with prediction and push alert and (2) Long-term warning with context-dependent multidimensional visualization, and examines the applicability of these functions by indicating that (1) will support both resident and those who are working at the operational level by being customized to disaster risk analysis for each target region/country/area, and (2) assist both policy-makers and sectoral ministries in target countries to use the analysis for evidence-based policy formulation, planning and investment towards building disaster-resilient society. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

"Combining Participatory Mapping, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning for Mapping Climate Induced Landslide Susceptibility in Lembeh Island, North Sulawesi","This study explored the use of participatory mapping and several machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, GMO Maxent, SVM, CART, and Random Forest) to map climate induced landslide susceptibility in Lembeh Island, North Sulawesi, based on Earth Observation data available in Google Earth Engine. Participatory mapping on landslide incidents were conducted in three villages, i.e., Kareko, Pintu Kota, and Pasir Panjang. Data used include digital elevation model from SRTM, multispectral imageries from Sentinel 2, and precipitation from CHIRPS. Terrain modelling was done to DEM to come up with elevation, slope, curvature, and aspect. A cloud free mosaic of Sentinel Images was created using the median reducer and then NDVI was calculated. Precipitation data from CHIRPS was sampled and interpolated using kriging and reduced to maximum and mean. Each algorithm was trained using 70% participatory mapping data and then the prediction was tested for accuracy using the last 30%. Results showed that Random Forest, SVM, CART, and GMO Maxent gave 0.98 testing accuracy and Naïve Bayes only 0.90. The map showed that due to the terrain condition, Lembeh Island is prone to Landslide and even though previously BNPB already provide a landslide hazard risk map, there were many areas not included on that map. Therefore, the map could become an input for BNPB and the Bitung City for developing a mitigation and adaptation strategy. Machine learning and cloud computing along with participatory mapping could also complement mechanistic or multi-criteria analysis using GIS model for landslide susceptibility mapping. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
Learning about climate change uncertainty enables flexible water infrastructure planning,"Water resources planning requires decision-making about infrastructure development under uncertainty in future regional climate conditions. However, uncertainty in climate change projections will evolve over the 100-year lifetime of a dam as new climate observations become available. Flexible strategies in which infrastructure is proactively designed to be changed in the future have the potential to meet water supply needs without expensive over-building. Evaluating tradeoffs between flexible and traditional static planning approaches requires extension of current paradigms for planning under climate change uncertainty which do not assess opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the future. We develop a new planning framework that assesses the potential to learn about regional climate change over time and therefore evaluates the appropriateness of flexible approaches today. We demonstrate it on a reservoir planning problem in Mombasa, Kenya. This approach identifies opportunities to reliably use incremental approaches, enabling adaptation investments to reach more vulnerable communities with fewer resources. © 2019, The Author(s)."
Structuralizing disaster-scene data through auto-captioning,"Disaster-scene images documenting the magnitude and effects of natural disasters nowadays can be easily collected through crowdsourcing aided by mobile technologies (e.g., smartphones or drones). One challenging issue that confronts the first-responders who desire the use of such data is the non-structured nature of these crowdsourced images. Among other techniques, one natural way is to structuralize disaster-scene images through captioning. Through captioning, their imagery contents are augmented by descriptive captions that further enable more effective search and query (S&Q). This work presents a preliminary test by exploiting an end-to-end deep learning framework with a linked CNN-LSTM architecture. Demonstration of the results and quantitative evaluation are presented that showcase the validity of the proposed concept. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."
Towards an integrated and realtime wayfinding framework for flood events,"City planners can encounter severe challenges during natural disasters. Flooding, for example, is considered as the number one cause of infrastructure damage across the world. Flooding can have a significant impact on personal property, commercial assets, and essential infrastructure, including power and gas delivery, and transportation. This paper focuses on the effects of flooding on transportation systems in the State of Iowa under a variety of flood scenarios, including 50, 100, 200, and 500-year return probabilities. We explore the impacts of flooding from institutional support (e.g., services including police, fire, and EMS) and general population (i.e., individuals distributed across cities) perspectives. Graph-theoretic methods are used in this study to determine the effects of flooding on road networks due to potential removal of paths that were once viable. This paper presents preliminary research into flood impacts on road infrastructure in Iowa and the development of an integrated real-time framework for analyzing those impacts. In future work, we plan to extend the framework developed in this study to provide a generalized decision-support system for cities and individuals. The framework will be open so city planners will be able explore”what if” flooding scenarios to find vulnerable areas and populations in their jurisdiction. These areas can be made more resilient to flooding effects by increasing the elevation of important roads, changing flow patterns, or increasing the height of bridges. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Evaluating Resilience-Centered development interventions with remote sensing,"Natural disasters are projected to increase in number and severity, in part due to climate change. At the same time a growing number of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation measures are being implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations, and substantial post-disaster donations are frequently pledged. At the same time there has been increasing demand for transparency and accountability, and thus evidence of those measures having a positive effect. We hypothesized that resilience-enhancing interventions should result in less damage during a hazard event, or at least quicker recovery. In this study we assessed recovery over a 3 year period of seven municipalities in the central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. We used very high resolution optical images ( < 1 m), and created detailed land cover and land use maps for four epochs before and after the event, using a machine learning approach with extreme gradient boosting. The spatially and temporally highly variable recovery maps were then statistically related to detailed questionnaire data acquired by DEval in 2012 and 2016, whose principal aim was to assess the impact of a 10 year land-planning intervention program by the German agency for technical cooperation (GIZ). The survey data allowed very detailed insights into DRR-related perspectives, motivations and drivers of the affected population. To some extent they also helped to overcome the principal limitation of remote sensing, which can effectively describe but not explain the reasons for differential recovery. However, while a number of causal links between intervention parameters and reconstruction was found, the common notion that a resilient community should recover better and more quickly could not be confirmed. The study also revealed a number of methodological limitations, such as the high cost for commercial image data not matching the spatially extensive but also detailed scale of field evaluations, the remote sensing analysis likely overestimating damage and thus providing incorrect recovery metrics, and image data catalogues especially for more remote communities often being incomplete. Nevertheless, the study provides a valuable proof of concept for the synergies resulting from an integration of socio-economic survey data and remote sensing imagery for recovery assessment. © 2019 by the authors."
Survivable deployments of optical sensor networks against multiple failures and disasters: A survey,"Optical sensing that integrates communication and sensing functions is playing a more and more important role in both military and civil applications. Incorporating optical sensing and optical communication, optical sensor networks (OSNs) that undertake the task of high-speed and large-capacity applications and sensing data transmissions have become an important communication infrastructure. However, multiple failures and disasters in OSNs can cause serious sensing provisioning problems. To ensure uninterrupted sensing data transmission, survivability has always been an important research emphasis. This paper focuses on the survivable deployment of OSNs against multiple failures and disasters. We first review and evaluate the existing survivability technologies developed for or applied to OSNs, such as fiber bus protection, self-healing architecture, and 1 + 1 protection. We then elaborate on the disaster-resilient survivability requirement of OSNs. Moreover, we propose a new k-node (edge) sensing connectivity concept, which ensures the connectivity between sensing data and users. Based on k-node (edge) sensing connectivity, the disaster-resilient survivability technologies are developed. The key technologies necessary to implement k-node (edge) sensing connectivity are also elaborated. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly. It can be used to improve the survivability of OSNs. This paper details potential development directions of survivability technologies of optical sensing in OSNs employing AI. © 2019 by the authors.

European strategies for adaptation to climate change with the Mayors adapt initiative by self-organizing maps,"The European Union (EU) has assigned municipal governments a key role in the transformations needed to achieve its climate and energy objectives. One of the main initiatives of the EU has been the ""The Covenant of Mayors"", launched in 2008, with impacts beyond Europe due to integration with the ""Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy"". This research focuses on local measures to adapt to climate change, verifying their differences between themselves, and aims to identify and characterize patterns in the different adaptation strategies examined. Further aims are (i) the collection of good practices, framed in the Mayors Adapt initiative, managing multidimensional data from the context and from its adaptation proposals; (ii) the classification of strategies in profiles and patterns using artificial neural networks based on the previous variables; (iii) the characterization and comparison of such profiles. The results substantiate the existence of several well-differentiated approaches, connected with their geographical context, vulnerability and politics. These results provide valuable information for its interpretation and for the planning of climate change adaptation actions, highlighting the value of the creation of networks of institutional collaboration targeted at each strategic framework. © 2019 by the authors."
Quantifying household resilience with high frequency data: Temporal dynamics and methodological options,"Resilience as a metric is of growing interest to development researchers and practitioners, particularly for those whose work concerns the effects of climate change, conflict and epidemics. The growing need for resilience measurements motivates this research, measurements that reflect the complex, dynamic features of welfare among populations living in shock-prone contexts. It presents insights from three measurement approaches to explore the dynamic, intra-annual effects of shocks on household well-being, mediated by household characteristics; one based on shock persistence, one based on the stochastic distribution of well-being, and one driven by machine learning algorithms and based on predictive power. The insights gained from the comparison of measurement approaches offer a fuller understanding of the factors driving resilience than any single approach on its own. The paper harnesses a novel data-set from the ‘Measuring Indicators for Resilience Analysis’ project, which, each month, tracks shocks and food security indicators for one year in a highly food insecure population in Malawi. Across approaches, our study consistently finds that shocks and food insecurity are very persistent, and that households living in the flood plains are more resilient. When focusing on specific shocks such as illness, the gender of the household head matters as-well. A broader search for predictors of food insecurity using LASSO and Random Forest algorithms uncovers other characteristics that affect resilience, such as the distance to drinking-water. The paper demonstrates how multiple complementary approaches can identify different but overlapping factors related to resilience, painting a fuller, richer picture. It also demonstrates the empirical benefits derived from using high-frequency data sets in the study of resilience. © 2019"
"An open risk index with learning indicators from OSM-tags, developed by machine learning and trained with the WorldRiskIndex","While climate change is already a real issue in many parts of the world, it is even more threatening the well-being of future generations. The SDG 1.5 explicitly aims to reduce the vulnerability and exposure to climate related hazards by 2030. TheWorld Risk Index (WRI) is one well-respected approach in profiling countries risk to natural hazard. To effectively monitor development and detect decision points on the climate resilience pathway, data of high resolution in space and time about the world's countries is of urgent importance. The World Risk Index will guide the supervised learning part resulting in an indicator set derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags, establishing on one hand an open risk index and adding deep explanatory power to its components by a qualitative discussion of the OSM themes. The second part explores with unsupervised algorithms the inherent characteristic of country groups classified by the open risk index and deduces common patterns of socio-economic vulnerability. Hence, the inherent challenge of this work is to substitute existing static indicators with new dynamic indicators, not only substituting them but also painting a more detailed picture. Moreover, new data sources still questioned often by their reliability compared to World Bank or census data, and therefore its opportunities are neglected instead of critically exploring the potential. This unique combination is not done yet and bares huge potential moreover united with the open source geo community to contribute a little piece of the puzzle for achieving the SDG 1.5. © 2019.

Development of geospatial techniques for natural hazard risk assessment in Thailand,"In order to mitigate environmental risk in Thailand it is essential to understand where and when specific geographic areas will be exposed to individual and multiple natural hazards. However, existing national scale approaches to natural hazard risk assessment are poorly adapted to deal with multiple hazards where significant uncertainties are associated with input variables and prior knowledge of the spatiotemporal nature of hazards is limited. To overcome these limitations, a geospatial approach has been developed that integrates machine learning within a GIS environment. Four hazards were investigated by Naïve Bayes while multiple hazards and their causalities were analysed via a Bayesian Network. Geospatial and Earth observation data representing past hazard events and their trigger variables were analysed to derive the probability of a hazard. Results revealed that lowland areas covering 22,868 and 139,193 km2, or 5% and 29% of total lowland areas were at-risk at a 90% probability-level of floods in rainy-seasons and droughts in the summer. High mountains and the plateaus were exposed to landslides over 90% probability in rainy, and forest fires in summer with over 60% probability, covering 37,727 and 40,069 km2, respectively. Within the Bayesian Network four relations of multiple hazards were investigated. At a 90% significance level approximately 190,250 km2 was at risk from a combination of forest fires and droughts. At a 80% or greater probability, 161,450, 120,027, and 102,628 km2 of land were at risk from a combination of 1) floods and landslides, 2) forest fires, floods, and landslides, and 3) all four hazards, respectively. The results were then used to produce the first fine-spatial scale multi-hazard assessment to support national policies on risk mitigation. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing."
Decision making on disaster management in agriculture with sentinel applications,"Climate change and increase of extreme weather events, besides the numerous consequences, affect significantly and put in risk the agriculture sectors. Natural disasters, such as floods and wildfires, are responsible for a great loss in agriculture production. National governments together with international bodies make an important effort to cooperate towards the response and resilience when a disaster occurs. In this frame the European Earth Observation Programme-Copernicus provides a series of observation data, in-situ measurements and services related, amongst others, to different types of disasters. Concerning the availability of this big volume of observation data, the aim of DiAS (Disaster and Agriculture Sentinel Applications) project is to revise the existing knowledge on remote sensing methods for mapping the extent of natural and/or man-made disaster over agricultural areas and propose improvements. The developed methodology will be implemented in a Decision Support System (DSS), which will be freely available and easy-to-use by non-experts. In this paper, the developed methodology focuses on mapping floods over agricultural areas. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery are used as input information for the comparison analysis before and after the event. The reference for results' evaluation is the corresponding information delivered by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS). Although, the evaluation results are in good agreement when they could be used, a reference of higher accuracy is needed in order to estimate accurately the quality of the output products. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing."
Machine learning based energy management system for grid disaster mitigation,"The recent increase in infiltration of distributed resources has challenged the traditional operation of power systems. Simultaneously, devastating effects of recent natural disasters have questioned the resilience of power infrastructure for an electricity dependent community. In this study, a solution has been presented in the form of a resilient smart grid network which utilises distributed energy resources (DERs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve the power availability during disastrous events. In addition to power electronics with load categorisation features, the presented system utilises ML tools to use the information from neighbouring units and external sources to make complicated logical decisions directed towards providing power to critical loads at all times. Furthermore, the provided model encourages consideration of ML tools as a part of smart grid design process together with power electronics and controls, rather than as an additional feature. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The effects of climate extremes on global agricultural yields,"Climate extremes, such as droughts or heat waves, can lead to harvest failures and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors - including mean climate as well as climate extremes - explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes. © 2019 The Author(s).

Use of artificial intelligence to improve resilience and preparedness against adverse flood events,"The main focus of this paper is the novel use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in natural disaster, more specifically flooding, to improve flood resilience and preparedness. Different types of flood have varying consequences and are followed by a specific pattern. For example, a flash flood can be a result of snow or ice melt and can occur in specific geographic places and certain season. The motivation behind this research has been raised from the Building Resilience into Risk Management (BRIM) project, looking at resilience in water systems. This research uses the application of the state-of-the-art techniques i.e., AI, more specifically Machin Learning (ML) approaches on big data, collected from previous flood events to learn from the past to extract patterns and information and understand flood behaviours in order to improve resilience, prevent damage, and save lives. In this paper, various ML models have been developed and evaluated for classifying floods, i.e., flash flood, lakeshore flood, etc. using current information i.e., weather forecast in different locations. The analytical results show that the Random Forest technique provides the highest accuracy of classification, followed by J48 decision tree and Lazy methods. The classification results can lead to better decision-making on what measures can be taken for prevention and preparedness and thus improve flood resilience. © 2019 by the authors."
Frontiers in data analytics for adaptation research: Topic modeling,"Rapid growth over the past two decades in digitized textual information represents untapped potential for methodological innovations in the adaptation governance literature that draw on machine learning approaches already being applied in other areas of computational social sciences. This Focus Article explores the potential for text mining techniques, specifically topic modeling, to leverage this data for large-scale analysis of the content of adaptation policy documents. We provide an overview of the assumptions and procedures that underlie the use of topic modeling, and discuss key areas in the adaptation governance literature where topic modeling could provide valuable insights. We demonstrate the diversity of potential applications for topic modeling with two examples that examine: (a) how adaptation is being talked about by political leaders in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and (b) how adaptation is being discussed by decision-makers and public administrators in Canadian municipalities using documents collected from 25 city council archives.

Effectiveness assessment of risk reduction measures at coastal areas using a decision support system: Findings from Emma storm,"Storms impact coastal areas often causing damages and losses at occupied areas. On a scenario of increasing human occupation at coastal zones and under climate change conditions (including sea level rise and increasing frequency of extreme sea levels), the consequences of storms are expected to be amplified if no adaptation or further management actions are implemented. The selection of the best possible coastal management measures, considering both costs and effectiveness, will be mandatory in the future, in order to optimise resources. This work analyses the performance of risk reduction measures (beach nourishment and receptors - house and infrastructures - removal), using a decision support system comprised by a morphodynamic numerical model (XBeach) and a Bayesian network based on the source-pathway-receptor concept. The effectiveness of the risk reduction measures is then assessed by a simple index expressing the consequences to the receptors. The approach was tested at Faro Beach by evaluating its performance for a particular storm, Emma (Feb/March 2018), which fiercely impacted the southern coast of Portugal. The output results from the modelling were compared to field observations of the actual damages caused by the storm. The combined use of both measures or the solely use of the nourishment would avoid almost all observed impacts from this storm. The work is pioneer on demonstrating the use of a decision support system for coastal regions validated against observed impacts for a high-energy storm event. The methodology and the proposed index are adaptable to any sandy coastal region and can be used to test (and improve) management options at a broad number of coastal areas worldwide, minimizing implementation costs and reducing the risk to the occupation and to the people. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
Towards Next Generation Knowledge Graphs for Disaster Management,"Timely access to information of critical resources is the fundamental requirement for the disaster management domain. Existing information systems to support the disaster management services lack interoperability and have several challenges to efficiently access heterogeneous information, especially open data. Such challenges include heterogeneity of data sources and formats (e.g., a hospital resource entity in Data. Gov versus OpenStreetMap), inconsistency of vocabularies (e.g., an entity type in Data.Gov schema versus OpenStreetMap schema), and incompleteness of information in a single source (e.g., lack of all relevant metadata for a hospital resource entity in Data. Gov). Knowledge graphs facilitate in addressing these challenges. They enable semantic computing applications to timely access relevant information about a critical resource across diverse data sources with both human and machine-understandable interpretations. In this paper, we will illustrate the design of a Disaster Knowledge Graph (DisasterKG) based system for querying critical resources and showcase how such interoperable information access could improve decision making throughout disaster management for preparedness, response, and recovery. On the flip side, our experience shows that such an approach may not be efficient by itself and cost-effective as still the considerable human effort is required for semantic information integration. Towards addressing this, we consider the Deep Learning based KG embedding approach as a potential alternative and argue for combining this approach with the traditional KG construction approach in complementary ways to get the best of both worlds. © 2019 IEEE."
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Image Analysis for Prioritizing Power System Restoration,"When natural disasters such as a hurricane or earthquake occur, it can result in considerable damage to the electricity delivery infrastructure. Different levels of damage will be experienced in different areas and neighborhoods. Restoration of the electricity system is critical for the population to be able to resume their activities. This paper describes how the process of power system restoration can be improved significantly by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and image processing methods to prioritize relief efforts. We develop a method to analyze satellite images before and after the destruction using an edge-detection and neural network method. A set of indicators of the level of damage inflicted on the power infrastructure is utilized in combination with known locations and type of critical loads such as hospitals, to develop restoration prioritization schemes. We then utilize deep learning techniques to analyze the prioritized areas to identify elements of the power system infrastructure directly affected by the disaster. © 2018 IEEE."
Integrating information from heterogeneous networks on social media to predict post-disaster returning behavior,"With the recent rise in frequency and intensity of severe disasters, increasing the resilience of urban systems is an urgent challenge. Local governments need to accurately predict the demand of public services such as gas, water and power after disasters in order to effectively allocate resources for recovery, and also to prevent secondary disasters. In practice, post-disaster surveys and interviews have been used to grasp the returning dynamics of evacuees. Here we propose a novel method for integrating information obtained from heterogeneous networks on social media that can be used to improve the predictability of returning behavior of evacuees after severe disasters. We validate our proposed method using a large Twitter dataset from Hurricane Sandy and verify that the model is capable of predicting 86% of the returning behavior of evacuees correctly, increasing the performance by 21% compared to conventional methods. Results imply that tweets posted near the individual's residential location and posts of online connected peers have significant marginal effect on predicting individuals’ returning behavior. The proposed method and gained insights could help decision makers in various agencies to predict the demand of public services in affected regions immediately after the disaster, enabling them to plan effective and efficient infrastructure repairing strategies given time and budget constraints. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
Decision Support System in Public Transport Planning for Promoting Urban Adaptation to Climate Change,"Current land use policy in developed countries result in many new constructions sites and urban development. Depending on the geodesign solutions, newly developed areas may influence their citizens to use private or public transport. Therefore, to design more resilient and eco-friendly neighbourhoods, it is important to incorporate public transport planning at the early stage of urban planning. In order to promote urban adaptation to climate change it is crucial to activate citizens to participate in decisions making process related to the common space and available facilities. Suitable for this purpose are the right tools for the presentation of various design solutions. This group of tools is called decision support systems. The aim of the research is verification of the suitability of the use of decision support system (CommunityViz) for public transport planning at the level for a master plan (local planning). The paper presents the possibility of using the CommunityViz system to create various scenarios of accessible public transport. Simulations were performed on the newly designed housing area in San Sebastian (Spain). The designed model for the neighbourhood was used during the workshop with citizens of San Sebastian, to incorporate their knowledge as local experts. Based on the master plan, three scenarios of bus stops location were proposed. The dynamic model enabled to assess how many citizens may probably live in acceptable distance to bus stops, which may reflect the number of people for whom public transport may be an attractive solution for transportation needs. The results showed high usefulness of the analyzed decision support system to solve the problem of public transport designing. Intuitive graphical presentation makes different variants clearly identified by all stakeholder groups. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
Simulation-based machine learning surrogate model for post-disaster road-bridge transportation network,"This study introduces a surrogate model using machine learning to predict the total repair time to restore a transportation network to its pre-disaster state in significantly less time than a competing genetic algorithm. The results can be used for resilience decision-making for mitigation and post-disaster recovery. The feature importance ranking facilitates resource allocation on bridge enhancement of mitigation planning and bridges repair of post-disaster recovery. Several machine learning algorithms are introduced to the proposed model, including gradient boosting tree, random forest, KNN, linear and elastic net regression. Through the empirical trials, we observe that the surrogate model can achieve high accuracy by using only a fraction of the available data thus improving computation performance. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

Learning disaster-scenes using deep learning methods,"Structures and infrastructure systems in modern society are designed and constructed with different levels of reliability and resilience to extreme hazards. It has been witnessed in numerous disaster events that built objects manifest different degree of damage, ranging from intact to collapse, even at locations that endure approximately the same level of hazard intensities. This further imply that given a complex disaster scene, for the decision making upon rapid recovery and monitoring of damaged structures, one immediate task is to rapidly identify and mark the damage levels of individual structures. With the advances in data collection tools today, e.g. digital cameras, LiDAR, smart phones, and their use through professional reconnaissance or crowdsourcing, collection of such perishable data become unprecedently easy today; however, the data understanding has become a bottle neck. Given such deluge of visual data collected after an extreme event, an autonomous and rapid understanding approach is demanded to understand the mechanics in disaster scenes. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence assisted approach through the use of deep learning, particularly a convolutional neural network-based semantic object method. This paper summarizes the data preparation, the training and validation of the deep learning framework, and evaluates quantitatively the performance of the predictive model for identifying both the causal types of disasters and the damage levels that they cause.

A study on the establishment of assessment method for debris flow disaster during typhoon period [颱洪時期空間致災風險推論系統之建置研究],"Taiwan is often attacked by typhoons due to its location at the subtropical region of Pacific Ocean. This island suffers from severe typhoon threats during summer and autumn each year, and different typhoon paths may cause different disasters in Taiwan. Nonlinear variation in meteorological factors of typhoon's rainfall causes the rainfall to be more complex and hence increases the difficulty in predicting the amount of typhoon rainfall. For this reason, various artificial intelligence optimization model is evaluated to establish a suitable and well forecasting system for typhoon rainfall according to gauged meteorological factors in this study. The previous database construction and necessary evaluation of gauged rainfall and meteorological factors of typhoon would be performed firstly. With the development of computing science and geospatial technology, a well-performed mixed system of multi- AI model (Deep Neural Network, DNN; and Genetic Programing, GP) could be expected.

Deep learning based framework for long-term management of bridges considering climate change effects,"Hydraulic-related hazards (e.g., flood and scour) are recognized as the leading stressors that threat the safety of bridges during their service life. In addition, climate change has been recently recognized as a significant factor that can drive changes to the frequency and intensity of hydraulic-related hazards. Consequently, current design, management, and decision-making methodologies should adapt to these changes to ensure the satisfactory performance of bridges under these hazards. This paper presents a multi-hazard probabilistic framework that can help bridge officials and decision makers to establish flood fragility curves with respect to service life and variability of the future floods. In this paper, downscaled climate data, adopted from the global climate models, are employed to predict future flood hazards at a given location. Time-variant scour depth profiles based on the predicted streamflow data are then estimated and used to predict the future condition of the bridge. Deep learning networks and finite element modeling are then employed to quantify the structural performance of the investigated bridge under applicable hazards. The proposed framework is illustrated on an existing bridge in Oklahoma. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report. All rights reserved."
Vision-based decision support for flood risk assessment using google street view images,"Flood is one of the most common and destructive natural disaster worldwide, both in terms of economic losses and human casualty. With the expected sea level rise for the next century, assessing flood risk become critical for coastal area residents and governments to make effective decisions about risk mitigation. To this end, Louisiana state in the U.S. have launched Comprehensive Master Plan and laid out $50 billion USD for coastal protection and restoration. However, most data for assessing flood risk in Louisiana are obsolete that were collected from street-level surveys in 1991 since it is too expensive to collect and update comprehensive data. As a result, this study proposes a vision-based approach using deep learning that can collect comprehensive data effectively and efficiently without human-involved street surveys. The proposed approach analyzes Google street view (GSV) images and simultaneously predicts several attributes of buildings that are necessary for assessing flood risks. The proposed approach can predict foundation type, height, and building type. Then, individual home or business owners can use a tool that visualize the flood risks to decide what measures to take to protect their assets. Also, local planners and policy makers will be able to develop “adaptation timelines” that prioritize infrastructure projects using the assessments of current and future flood risks. © 2019 by DEStech Publications, Inc.

Hydrological early warning system based on a deep learning runoff model coupled with a meteorological forecast,"The intensification of the hydrological cycle because of global warming raises concerns about future floods and their impact on large cities where exposure to these events has also increased. The development of adequate adaptation solutions such as early warning systems is crucial. Here, we used deep learning (DL) for weather-runoff forecasting in región Metropolitana of Chile, a large urban area in a valley at the foot of the Andes Mountains, with more than 7 million inhabitants. The final goal of this research is to develop an effective forecasting system to provide timely information and support in real-time decision making. For this purpose, we implemented a coupled model of a near-future global meteorological forecast with a short-range runoff forecasting system. Starting from a traditional hydrological conceptual model, we defined the hydro-meteorological and geomorphological variables that were used in the data-driven weather-runoff forecast models. The meteorological variables were obtained through statistical scaling of the Global Forecast System (GFS), thus enabling near-future prediction, and two data-driven approaches were implemented for predicting the entire hourly flow time-series in the near future (3 days), a simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a Deep Learning (DL) approach based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. We show that the coupling between meteorological forecasts and data-driven weather-runoff forecast models are able to satisfy two basic requirements that any early warning system should have: The forecast should be given in advance, and it should be accurate and reliable. In this context, DL significantly improves runoff forecast when compared with a traditional data-driven approach such as ANN, being accurate in predicting time-evolution of output variables, with an error of 5% for DL, measured in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) for predicting the peak flow, compared to 15.5% error for ANN, which is adequate to warn communities at risk and initiate disaster response operations. © 2019 by the authors."
Multi-hazard exposure mapping using machine learning techniques: A case study from Iran,"Mountainous areas are highly prone to a variety of nature-triggered disasters, which often cause disabling harm, death, destruction, and damage. In this work, an attempt was made to develop an accurate multi-hazard exposure map for a mountainous area (Asara watershed, Iran), based on state-of-the art machine learning techniques. Hazard modeling for avalanches, rockfalls, and floods was performed using three state-of-the-art models-support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized additive model (GAM). Topo-hydrological and geo-environmental factors were used as predictors in the models. A flood dataset (n = 133 flood events) was applied, which had been prepared using Sentinel-1-based processing and ground-based information. In addition, snow avalanche (n = 58) and rockfall (n = 101) data sets were used. The data set of each hazard type was randomly divided to two groups: Training (70%) and validation (30%). Model performance was evaluated by the true skill score (TSS) and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) criteria. Using an exposure map, the multi-hazard map was converted into a multi-hazard exposure map. According to both validation methods, the SVM model showed the highest accuracy for avalanches (AUC = 92.4%, TSS = 0.72) and rockfalls (AUC = 93.7%, TSS = 0.81), while BRT demonstrated the best performance for flood hazards (AUC = 94.2%, TSS = 0.80). Overall, multi-hazard exposure modeling revealed that valleys and areas close to the Chalous Road, one of the most important roads in Iran, were associated with high and very high levels of risk. The proposed multi-hazard exposure framework can be helpful in supporting decision making on mountain social-ecological systems facing multiple hazards. © 2019 by the authors."
A Reinforcement Learning-Based Stakeholder Value Aggregation Model for Collaborative Decision Making on Disaster Resilience,"Building a disaster resilient community is a shared responsibility among multi-sector stakeholders, including government officials, private sectors, non-government organizations (NGOs), and community residents. Different stakeholders have different concerns and needs, and they make different decisions regarding the priorities of implementing disaster resilience strategies given limited resources. These differences are deeply rooted in their value systems, which are defined as ranked systems of things that are of importance, merit, and utility to the stakeholders. The differences in their value system cause conflicts and disputes for disaster-related decision making, which may result in longer decision-making time and huge financial losses. Therefore, there is a need to understand and systemically integrate the value systems of multi-sector stakeholders to support more effective and collaborative decision making in disaster resilience. To address such need, this paper proposes a stakeholder value aggregation (SVA) model to systematically and quantitatively aggregate divergent stakeholder value systems by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed SVA model was illustrated using a case study that focuses on aggregating the value systems of responsible and impacted stakeholders. The paper also discusses our proposed framework for a cloud-based decision support system that allows for automatic aggregation of divergent stakeholder value systems. The model, together with its potential application of cloud-based decision support system will facilitate more collaborative and efficient decision making by identifying the collective value priorities on disaster resilience practices. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."
Multi-Network Vulnerability Causal Model for Infrastructure Co-Resilience,"Resilience is mostly considered as a single-dimension attribute of a system. Most of the recent works on resilience treat it as a single-dimension attribute of a system or study the different dimensions of the resilience separately without considering its multi-domain nature. In this paper, we propose an advanced causal inference approach combined with machine learning to characterize the spatiooral and multi-domain vulnerability of an urban infrastructure system against extreme weather events. With the proposed causality approach, we perform vulnerability assessment for electricity outages and roadway closures through considering the meteorological, topographic, and demographic attributes of urban areas in the aftermath of the extreme weather events. This proposed holistic approach to multi-network vulnerability assessment paves the ground for characterizing the resilience in a multi-network scheme, which is coined as the concept of 'co-resilience.' The proposed causal framework for multi-network vulnerability assessment is validated using the actual data for the impacts of the Hurricane Hermine 2016 and the January Storm 2017 on the Tallahassee, FL, USA. The results achieved from the proposed causality approach indicate a high causal relationship among electricity outages, roadway closures, topographic aspects, and meteorological variables in an urban area. Findings show that the proposed multi-network approach for vulnerability assessment improves the performance of the estimation and prediction of the disaster outcomes and the evaluation of the overall system resilience. © 2013 IEEE."
Growth of the Decision Tree: Advances in Bottom-Up Climate Change Risk Management,"There has recently been a return in climate change risk management practice to bottom-up, robustness-based planning paradigms introduced 40 years ago. The World Bank's decision tree framework (DTF) for “confronting climate uncertainty” is one incarnation of those paradigms. In order to better represent the state of the art in climate change risk assessment and evaluation techniques, this paper proposes: (1) an update to the DTF, replacing its “climate change stress test” with a multidimensional stress test; and (2) the addition of a Bayesian network framework that represents joint probabilistic behavior of uncertain parameters as sensitivity factors to aid in the weighting of scenarios of concern (the combination of conditions under which a water system fails to meet its performance targets). Using the updated DTF, water system planners and project managers would be better able to understand the relative magnitudes of the varied risks they face, and target investments in adaptation measures to best reduce their vulnerabilities to change. Next steps for the DTF include enhancements in: modeling of extreme event risks; coupling of human-hydrologic systems; integration of surface water and groundwater systems; the generation of tradeoffs between economic, social, and ecological factors; incorporation of water quality considerations; and interactive data visualization. © 2018 American Water Resources Association"
The role of cultural heritage in urban resilience enhancement,"Place-based urban regeneration suggests the need of shift from a fragmented to a systemic model to understand the interrelation between sub-systems and the effects that a changing sub-system can pose on the others. In this context, urban regeneration strategies resilience oriented may include actions able to improve the economic, physical, social and environmental conditions and thus the human well-being of urban areas. The great quantity of information involved in the resilience assessment of urban systems require the use of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) that make possible to record, analyze and summarize data with different spatial and temporal resolution. In the present work, we described the structure of a framework for the Resilience and Disaster Risk Management. Particularly, we focused our attention on the identification of indices expressing the contribution of cultural heritage in making cities resilience toward natural hazards. These tools allow identifying replicable and scaling-up successful practices and converting the impalpable values of cultural heritage in measurable ones. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019."
Social media data and post-disaster recovery,"This study introduces a multi-step methodology for analyzing social media data during the post-disaster recovery phase of Hurricane Sandy. Its outputs include identification of the people who experienced the disaster, estimates of their physical location, assessments of the topics they discussed post-disaster, analysis of the tract-level relationships between the topics people discussed and tract-level internal attributes, and a comparison of these outputs to those of people who did not experience the disaster. Faith-based, community, assets, and financial topics emerged as major topics of discussion within the context of the disaster experience. The differences between predictors of these topics compared to those of people who did not experience the disaster were investigated in depth, revealing considerable differences among vulnerable populations. The use of this methodology as a new Machine Learning Algorithm to analyze large volumes of social media data is advocated in the conclusion."
Budget-constrained demand-weighted network design for resilient infrastructure,"Our work is motivated by an important network design problem in climate adaptation. As floods become more frequent and severe due to climate change, it is increasingly crucial that road infrastructure be strategically upgraded to support post-disaster recovery efforts and normal functionality. We focus on the problem of allocating a fixed budget towards restoring edges to maximize the satisfied travel demand between locations in a network, which we formalize as the budget-constrained prize-collecting Steiner forest problem. We prove that the satisfiable travel demand objective exhibits restricted supermodularity over forests, and utilize this property to design an iterative algorithm based on maximizing successive modular lower bounds for the objective that finds better solutions than a baseline greedy approach. We also propose an extremely fast heuristic for maximizing modular functions subject to knapsack and graph matroid constraints that can be used as a subroutine in the iterative algorithm, or as a standalone method that matches the greedy baseline in terms of quality but is orders of magnitude faster. We evaluate the algorithms on synthetic data, and apply them to a real-world instance of retrofitting the Senegal national road network against flooding. © 2019 IEEE."
Disaster mapping as decision support system to decrease abrasion impact due to climate change in Bantul Coastal Area,"Global climate change affects the physical condition of coastal areas, one of which is the rise in wave height. The increase in wave height allows higher volume of carried substrate on the swash and backwash motions. These events have an impact on increasing the abrasion intensity, specifically on the coastal areas which consist of sand material (beaches). Coastal area of Bantul Regency is one of the areas exposed to abrasion because it is directly facing the Indian Ocean. Application of atmospheric science and technology is needed to reduce the impact of losses caused by abrasion. Disaster mapping is an effort to reach that expectation. This research aimed (1) to identify abrasion susceptibility, and (2) to analyse social vulnerability due to abrasion in Bantul coastal area. The assessment was done by GIS-based spatial-multi criteria analysis to process physical and socio-cultural aspects in regards of abrasion, which the analytical unit was the coastal area between Opak and Progo River estuaries. This research resulted in susceptibility map and social vulnerability map as references for coastal mitigation directives supporting the resilience of region and community towards climate change. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Machine learning methods for crop yield prediction and climate change impact assessment in agriculture,"Crop yields are critically dependent on weather. A growing empirical literature models this relationship in order to project climate change impacts on the sector. We describe an approach to yield modeling that uses a semiparametric variant of a deep neural network, which can simultaneously account for complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional datasets, as well as known parametric structure and unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. Using data on corn yield from the US Midwest, we show that this approach outperforms both classical statistical methods and fully-nonparametric neural networks in predicting yields of years withheld during model training. Using scenarios from a suite of climate models, we show large negative impacts of climate change on corn yield, but less severe than impacts projected using classical statistical methods. In particular, our approach is less pessimistic in the warmest regions and the warmest scenarios."
Mining Twitter data for improved understanding of disaster resilience,"Coastal communities faced with multiple hazards have shown uneven responses and behaviors. These responses and behaviors could be better understood by analyzing real-time social media data through categorizing them into the three phases of the emergency management: preparedness, response, and recovery. This study analyzes the spatial–temporal patterns of Twitter activities during Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. Northeast on 29 October 2012. The study area includes 126 counties affected by Hurricane Sandy. The objectives are threefold: (1) to derive a set of common indexes from Twitter data so that they can be used for emergency management and resilience analysis; (2) to examine whether there are significant geographical and social disparities in disaster-related Twitter use; and (3) to test whether Twitter data can improve postdisaster damage estimation. Three corresponding hypotheses were tested. Results show that common indexes derived from Twitter data, including ratio, normalized ratio, and sentiment, could enable comparison across regions and events and should be documented. Social and geographical disparities in Twitter use existed in the Hurricane Sandy event, with higher disaster-related Twitter use communities generally being communities of higher socioeconomic status. Finally, adding Twitter indexes into a damage estimation model improved the adjusted R2 from 0.46 to 0.56, indicating that social media data could help improve postdisaster damage estimation, but other environmental and socioeconomic variables influencing the capacity to reducing damage might need to be included. The knowledge gained from this study could provide valuable insights into strategies for utilizing social media data to increase resilience to disasters."
Humanitarian applications of machine learning with remote-sensing data: review and case study in refugee settlement mapping,"The coordination of humanitarian relief, e.g. in a natural disaster or a conflict situation, is often complicated by a scarcity of data to inform planning. Remote sensing imagery, from satellites or drones, can give important insights into conditions on the ground, including in areas which are difficult to access. Applications include situation awareness after natural disasters, structural damage assessment in conflict, monitoring human rights violations or population estimation in settlements. We review machine learning approaches for automating these problems, and discuss their potential and limitations. We also provide a case study of experiments using deep learning methods to count the numbers of structures in multiple refugee settlements in Africa and the Middle East. We find that while high levels of accuracy are possible, there is considerable variation in the characteristics of imagery collected from different sensors and regions. In this, as in the other applications discussed in the paper, critical inferences must be made from a relatively small amount of pixel data. We, therefore, consider that using machine learning systems as an augmentation of human analysts is a reasonable strategy to transition from current fully manual operational pipelines to ones which are both more efficient and have the necessary levels of quality control.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'."
Hydraulic diversity of forests regulates ecosystem resilience during drought,"Plants influence the atmosphere through fluxes of carbon, water and energy1, and can intensify drought through land–atmosphere feedback effects2,3,4. The diversity of plant functional traits in forests, especially physiological traits related to water (hydraulic) transport, may have a critical role in land–atmosphere feedback, particularly during drought. Here we combine 352 site-years of eddy covariance measurements from 40 forest sites, remote-sensing observations of plant water content and plant functional-trait data to test whether the diversity in plant traits affects the response of the ecosystem to drought. We find evidence that higher hydraulic diversity buffers variation in ecosystem flux during dry periods across temperate and boreal forests. Hydraulic traits were the predominant significant predictors of cross-site patterns in drought response. By contrast, standard leaf and wood traits, such as specific leaf area and wood density, had little explanatory power. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and is likely to have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects in a changing climate."
Combining machine-learning topic models and spatiotemporal analysis of social media data for disaster footprint and damage assessment,"Current disaster management procedures to cope with human and economic losses and to manage a disaster’s aftermath suffer from a number of shortcomings like high temporal lags or limited temporal and spatial resolution. This paper presents an approach to analyze social media posts to assess the footprint of and the damage caused by natural disasters through combining machine-learning techniques (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for semantic information extraction with spatial and temporal analysis (local spatial autocorrelation) for hot spot detection. Our results demonstrate that earthquake footprints can be reliably and accurately identified in our use case. More, a number of relevant semantic topics can be automatically identified without a priori knowledge, revealing clearly differing temporal and spatial signatures. Furthermore, we are able to generate a damage map that indicates where significant losses have occurred. The validation of our results using statistical measures, complemented by the official earthquake footprint by US Geological Survey and the results of the HAZUS loss model, shows that our approach produces valid and reliable outputs. Thus, our approach may improve current disaster management procedures through generating a new and unseen information layer in near real time."
Integrating human behaviour dynamics into flood disaster risk assessment,"The behaviour of individuals, businesses, and government entities before, during, and immediately after a disaster can dramatically affect the impact and recovery time. However, existing risk-assessment methods rarely include this critical factor. In this Perspective, we show why this is a concern, and demonstrate that although initial efforts have inevitably represented human behaviour in limited terms, innovations in flood-risk assessment that integrate societal behaviour and behavioural adaptation dynamics into such quantifications may lead to more accurate characterization of risks and improved assessment of the effectiveness of risk-management strategies and investments. Such multidisciplinary approaches can inform flood-risk management policy development."
Optimal Design of LIDs in Urban Stormwater Systems Using a Harmony-Search Decision Support System,"During the last years, climate changes and urbanization are causing huge urban pluvial flood events in many countries in the world, driving to both develop and apply effective and innovative approaches for the design and management of urban stormwater systems. The gradual urbanization is provoking the increase of impervious surfaces and, consequently, of surface runoff and velocity and the reduction of concentration times of watersheds, both increasing soil erosion and worsening the water quality as a consequence of the intensive contamination. In this field, Low Impact Development (LID) practices for urban runoff control can be intended as an effective approach to both improve the urban resilience against the flooding risk and assure environmental interventions to adequate the urban stormwater systems to both climate and land use changes. In this paper, a Decision Support System (DSS) for the optimal design of LIDs in urban watershed is presented and discussed. The procedure is tested on Fuorigrotta (IT) and Ponticelli (IT) urban watersheds, with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of LIDs application in reducing both the flooded and conveyed volumes, at the expense of cost-effective solutions. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V."
Susceptibility of existing and planned Chinese railway system subjected to rainfall-induced multi-hazards,"Rainfall-induced flooding, landslides, and debris flows have been the main natural hazards that impact on the safety and operation of the Chinese railway system. With the rapid increase of railway length and passengers over the past 20 years, a better understanding of susceptibility of railway infrastructures to rainfall-induced hazards is urgently needed, in particular because extreme precipitation has increased in many parts of China. This paper provides a quantitative approach for susceptibility assessment of transportation system subjected to natural hazards at a relatively large scale. The susceptibility of both existing and planned Chinese railway system subjected to rainfall-induced multi-hazards is quantitatively analyzed using a machine learning method (Random Forest) and historical disaster events triggered between 1980 and 1998. The main environmental and climatic factors that influence the safety of the railway system are identified and ranked. Susceptibility maps illustrate the hotspot zones of both existing and planned railways in China that need significant attention and preventative action to reduce potential losses and disruption of operation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
An intelligent system on knowledge generation and communication about flooding,"Communities are at risk from extreme events and natural disasters that can lead to dangerous situations for residents. Improving resilience by helping people learn how to better prepare for, recover from, and adapt to disasters is critical to reduce the impacts of these extreme events. This project presents an intelligent system, Flood AI, designed to improve societal preparedness for flooding by providing a knowledge engine that uses voice recognition, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing based on a generalized ontology for disasters with a primary focus on flooding. The knowledge engine uses flood ontology to connect user input to relevant knowledge discovery channels on flooding by developing a data acquisition and processing framework using environmental observations, forecast models, and knowledge bases. The framework's communication channels include web-based systems, agent-based chatbots, smartphone applications, automated web workflows, and smart home devices, opening the knowledge discovery for flooding to many unique use cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
Sensitivity of drought resilience-vulnerability- exposure to hydrologic ratios in contiguous United States,"The atmospheric water supply and demand dynamics determine a region's potential water resources. The hydrologic ratios, such as, aridity index, evaporation ratio and runoff coefficients are useful indicators to quantify the atmospheric water dynamics at watershed to regional scales. In this study, we developed a modeling framework using a machine learning approach to predict hydrologic ratios for watersheds located in contiguous United States (CONUS) by utilizing a set of climate, soil, vegetation, and topographic variables. Overall, the proposed modeling framework is able to simulate the hydrologic ratios at watershed scale with a considerable accuracy. The concept of non-parametric elasticity was applied to study the potential influence of the estimated hydrologic ratios on various drought characteristics (resilience, vulnerability, and exposure) for river basins located in CONUS. Spatial sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios suggests that an increase in hydrologic ratios may result in augmentation of magnitude of drought indicators in majority of the river basins. Aridity index seems to have higher influence on drought characteristics in comparison to other hydrologic ratios. It was observed that the machine learning approach based on random forests algorithm can efficiently estimate the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios provided sufficient data is available. In addition to that, the non-parametric based elasticity approach can identify the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on spatial drought characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
"SWAT-MODSIM-PSO optimization of multi-crop planning in the Karkheh River Basin, Iran, under the impacts of climate change","Agriculture is one of the environmental/economic sectors that may adversely be affected by climate change, especially, in already nowadays water-scarce regions, like the Middle East. One way to cope with future changes in absolute as well as seasonal (irrigation) water amounts can be the adaptation of the agricultural crop pattern in a region, i.e. by planting crops which still provide high yields and so economic benefits to farmers under such varying climate conditions. To do this properly, the whole cascade starting from climate change, effects on hydrology and surface water availability, subsequent effects on crop yield, agricultural areas available, and, finally, economic value of a multi-crop cultivation pattern must be known. To that avail, a complex coupled simulation-optimization tool SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO (SLMP) has been developed here and used to find the future optimum cultivation area of crops for the maximization of the economic benefits in five irrigation-fed agricultural plains in the south of the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) southwest Iran. Starting with the SWAT distributed hydrological model, the KR-streamflow as well as the inflow into the Karkheh-reservoir, as the major storage of irrigation water, is calibrated and validated, based on 1985–2004 observed discharge data. In the subsequent step, the SWAT-predicted streamflow is fed into the MODSIM river basin Decision Support System to simulate and optimize the water allocation between different water users (agricultural, environmental, municipal and industrial) under standard operating policy (SOP) rules. The final step is the maximization of the economic benefit in the five agricultural plains through constrained PSO (particle swarm optimization) by adjusting the cultivation areas (decision variables) of different crops (wheat, barley, maize and “others”), taking into account their specific prizes and optimal crop yields under water deficiency, with the latter computed in the LINGO-sub-optimization module embedded in the SLMP-tool. For the optimization of the agricultural benefits in the KRB in the near future (2038–2060), quantile-mapping (QM) bias-corrected downscaled predictors for daily precipitation and temperatures of the HadGEM2-ES GCM-model under RCP4.5- and RCP8.5-emission scenarios are used as climate drivers in the streamflow- and crop yield simulations of the SWAT-model, leading to corresponding changes in the final outcome (economic benefit) of the SLMP-tool. In fact, whereas for the historical period (1985–2004) a total annual benefit of 94.2 million US$ for all multi-crop areas in KRB is computed, there is a decrease to 88.3 million US$ and 72.1 million US$ for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, in the near future (2038–2060) prediction period. In fact, this future income decrease is due to a substantial shift from cultivation areas devoted nowadays to high-price wheat and barley in the winter season to low-price maize-covered areas in the future summers, owing to a future seasonal change of SWAT-predicted irrigation water available, i.e. less in the winter and more in the summer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
An evacuation management framework based on urban data and personalized mobility information,"Climate change is responsible for a number of physical disasters that cost the loss of many lives every year. Additionally, the increased terrorism in global level rises the need of accurate information and security of the population. Taking this into consideration, there is an increased necessity of a framework that provides decision support services to Urban Transport System (UTS) related authorities. Even though the majority of existing safety systems are able to generate evacuation plans, few of them consider the effect of an emergent event over the road network. Additionally, there is a gap in the communication between the authorities and the general public during the emergencies. This work presents a multidimensional framework that processes and seamlessly fuses information from the road network, the emergent event, weather conditions, traffic related data and personalized information of the involved users, providing decision support services and information to UTS authorities. In addition, the framework provides critical information and personalized route guidance to the general public through a mobile application. The proposed framework introduces the collaborative rescue procedure, where users that are in danger can declare it via the mobile application, while willing citizens can be assigned and guided by the system in order to help others. The existence of a centralized management system in conjunction with a decentralized mobile application facilitates the management of the emergency and the implementation of the respond plan. © 2018 IEEE."
Optimal fresh water blending: A methodological approach to improve the resilience of water supply systems,"Climate change and socioeconomic factors have increased the complexity of urban water supply systems. Thus, fresh water sources are being gradually diversified to improve the reliability and resilience of the systems. However, as the number of source blending options grows, optimization tools are needed to design drinking water supply systems that comply with indicators of cost, resilience, and water quality. This paper proposes a pioneering methodological approach, based on an ant-colony-optimization (ACO) algorithm, to optimize the blending of drinking water from different sources to minimize operational costs of a given system originating from a number of impaired water sources while complying with water quality standards. To evidence the potential of the ACO algorithm to solve such a system, a virtual case study was designed that considers eight fresh water sources, including seawater desalination and potable reuse. Seven scenarios were developed with different weightings to service outage, water conveyance and treatment costs while complying with water quality goals in regard to total organic carbon, nitrates, and total dissolved solids. It was shown that the cost per volumetric unit of water can vary considerably depending on the weightings of the three cost items. This paper provides a rigorous scientific approach to propose a methodology supporting the decision-making process of selecting a mixture of different sources to achieve the overall lowest system cost. Hence, this work contributes to improving the resilience and sustainability of urban water supplies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment Tool (PFRA) for rainwater management and adaptation to climate change in newly urbanised areas,"The aim of this research is to develop the Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment tool (PFRA) for rainwater management and adaptation to climate change in newly urbanised areas. PFRA allows pluvial hazard assessment, as well as pluvial flood risk mapping. The original model was created using ArcGIS software with the ArcHydro extension, and the script was written using the Python programming language. The PFRA model effectively combines information about land cover, soils, microtopography (LiDAR data), and projected hydro-meteorological conditions, which enables the identification of the spatial and temporal distribution of pluvial flood risks in newly developed areas. Further improvements to the PFRA concern the quantification of pluvial flood-related damages, the application of high resolution precipitation data, and the optimisation of coding. © 2018 by the authors."
Disaster response aided by tweet classification with a domain adaptation approach,"Social media platforms such as Twitter provide valuable information for aiding disaster response during emergency events. Machine learning could be used to identify such information. However, supervised learning algorithms rely on labelled data, which is not readily available for an emerging target disaster. While labelled data might be available for a prior source disaster, supervised classifiers learned only from the source disaster may not perform well on the target disaster, as each event has unique characteristics (e.g., type, location, and culture) and may cause different social media responses. To address this limitation, we propose to use a domain adaptation approach, which learns classifiers from unlabelled target data, in addition to source labelled data. Our approach uses the Naïve Bayes classifier, together with an iterative Self-Training strategy. Experimental results on the task of identifying tweets relevant to a disaster of interest show that the domain adaptation classifiers are better as compared to the supervised classifiers learned only from labelled source data. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
Multi-Dimensional Infrastructure Resilience Modeling: An Application to Hurricane-Prone Electric Power Distribution Systems,"Despite the scientific consensus on the multivariate nature of resilience, the majority of the existing approaches either focus on modeling a single dimension of resilience, or model its various dimensions separately. In this paper, we propose leveraging one of the most recent advances in statistical machine learning to characterize the multivariate inoperability of an electric power distribution system as a non-linear function of the system's topology, hurricane hazard characteristics, and the service area's climate and topography. The model can then be used as a predictive tool to assess various investment strategies for enhancing the multivariate resilience of the system. The results established the number of customers served, tree-trimming frequency, hurricane intensity, land-cover types, and soil moisture as the key predictors of the distribution system's multivariate inoperability. The variable influence heat-map helped identify the clusters of predictors that jointly influence one or more measures of inoperability. Moreover, the partial dependence plots were leveraged to examine the non-linear relationships between the focal predictors and the various measures of hurricane impact. The estimated multivariate inoperability model was then used to assess resilience enhancement strategies. The proposed approach can help infrastructure managers and urban planners to approximate the multivariate resilience of infrastructure holistically, predict the system's resilience under various stochastic perturbation regimes, and identify effective strategies to improve the overall resilience of the system. © 2013 IEEE."
From data modeling to algorithmic modeling in the big data era: Water resources security in the asia-pacific region under conditions of climate change,"Advances in computing technologies allow machine learning algorithms to automatically, repeatedly and quickly apply complex mathematical calculations to water resources and environmental security challenges. The concomitant increase in “big data” research, development, and applications is also driving the popularity of real-time automated model building and data mining for these security problems under conditions of climate change. The last decade has seen considerable growth in the theory and application in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is shown that machine learning, a subset of AI, constitutes a data analysis method that focuses on the development of algorithms that can iteratively learn from data to uncover previously “hidden insights” for environmental security managers in the Asia Pacific. It is concluded that deep machine learning (i.e. deep learning) can help to reduce losses to ecosystems, livelihoods, and businesses. In particular, these losses can be more likely prevented and minimized through the use of data and algorithmic modeling that improves community resilience by institutionalizing sustainable hazard mitigation within accepted processes of water resources community planning and economic development before disasters happen. Key environmental threats including foods, population extinction, water quality and climate change are considered. The difference between the algorithmic modeling and data modeling cultures are summarized with reference to the schools in which they originate, the assumptions they work on, the type of data they deal with, and the techniques used. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."
"Challenges of modeling community-driven disaster operations management in disaster recurrent areas: The example of Portsmouth, Virginia","Although one of the dominant paradigms in managing disaster operations is that of modeling decisions around the activities of humanitarian organizations, recent literature has highlighted the importance of managing disaster operations from the perspective of the affected community. Modeling community-driven disaster operations has a unique set of challenges, however, several of which are highlighted in this research effort. These include engaging the community and coordinating amongst multiple decision makers, defining a clear community objective, and planning with long decision horizons. Using the urban area of Portsmouth, Virginia as a case study, this work in progress paper demonstrates a decision support system-based approach which addresses these critical elements of community-driven disaster operations management. © Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management ISCRAM.

River flood prediction using fuzzy neural Networks: An investigation on automated network architecture,"Urban floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters globally and improved flood prediction is essential for better flood management. Today, high-resolution real-time datasets for flood-related variables are widely available. These data can be used to create data-driven models for improved real-time flood prediction. However, data-driven models have uncertainty stemming from a number of issues: The selection of input data, the optimisation of model architecture, estimation of model parameters, and model output. Addressing these sources of uncertainty will improve flood prediction. In this research, a fuzzy neural network is proposed to predict peak flow in an urban river. The network uses fuzzy numbers to account for the uncertainty in the output and model parameters. An algorithm that uses possibility theory is used to train the network. An adaptation of the automated neural pathway strength feature selection (ANPSFS) method is used to select the input features. A search and optimisation algorithm is used to select the network architecture. Data for the Bow River in Calgary, Canada are used to train and test the network. © 2017 IWA Publishing."
A machine-learning approach to forecasting remotely sensed vegetation health,"Drought threatens food and water security around the world, and this threat is likely to become more severe under climate change. High-resolution predictive information can help farmers, water managers, and others to manage the effects of drought. We have created an open-source tool to produce short-term forecasts of vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using data that are global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets and training gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to predict future values of the enhanced vegetation index. We compared the predictive power of different sets of variables (MODIS surface reflectance data and Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems, climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Performance in California is higher because of more cloud-free days and less missing data. In both regions, the correlation between the actual and model predicted vegetation health values in agricultural areas is above 0.75. Predictive power more than doubles in agricultural areas compared to a baseline model."
Towards Practical Usage of a Domain Adaptation Algorithm in the Early Hours of a Disaster.,"Many machine learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the information overload in social media data
during an emergency situation. Among such techniques, domain adaptation approaches present greater potential as
compared to supervised algorithms because they don’t require labeled data from the current disaster for training.
However, the use of domain adaptation approaches in practice is sporadic at best. One reason is that domain
adaptation algorithms have parameters that need to be tuned using labeled data from the target disaster, which is
presumably not available. To address this limitation, we perform a study on one domain adaptation approach with
the goal of understanding how much source data is needed to obtain good performance in a practical situation, and
what parameter values of the approach give overall good performance. The results of our study provide useful
insights into the practical application of domain adaptation algorithms in real crisis situations."
Resilience potential of the Ethiopian coffee sector under climate change,"Coffee farming provides livelihoods for around 15 million farmers in Ethiopia and generates a quarter of the country's export earnings. Against a backdrop of rapidly increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall, there is an urgent need to understand the influence of climate change on coffee production. Using a modelling approach in combination with remote sensing, supported by rigorous ground-truthing, we project changes in suitability for coffee farming under various climate change scenarios, specifically by assessing the exposure of coffee farming to future climatic shifts. We show that 39–59% of the current growing area could experience climatic changes that are large enough to render them unsuitable for coffee farming, in the absence of significant interventions or major influencing factors. Conversely, relocation of coffee areas, in combination with forest conservation or re-establishment, could see at least a fourfold (>400%) increase in suitable coffee farming area. We identify key coffee-growing areas that are susceptible to climate change, as well as those that are climatically resilient."
Identifying best crop management practices for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in Northeastern Ethiopia under climate change condition,"Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is one of the important cool season food legumes in the semi-arid northeastern Ethiopia; however, its productivity is adversely affected by a number of abiotic and biotic factors. The objectives of this study were to assess impacts of projected climate change on grain yield of chickpea by 2030 s (2020–2049) and 2050 s (2040–2069) and to identify crop management options that increase productivity of the crop. The CROPGRO-chickpea model in DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) was used to assess impacts of projected climate change on chickpea and to identify adaptation options. The crop model was first calibrated and evaluated in the study area for simulating growth, yield and water balance of the soil. The result of the model calibration and evaluation showed that there were close agreement between the simulated and observed values that showed the performance of the model to simulate growth, phenology and yield of chickpea under semi-arid northeastern Ethiopian condition. The calibrated model was used to assess impacts of projected climate changes on chickpea and identify crop management options. The impact of projected climate change was assessed for 2030 s and 2050 s time periods under all the RCPs with and without CO2 fertilization. To identify crop management options, different varieties of chickpea, supplemental irrigation and change in planting dates have been evaluated. The result of climate change impact analysis on chickpea showed that grain yield is predicted to significantly increase both by 2030 s and 2050 s under CO2 fertilization condition across all the RCPs as compared to baseline grain yield (1961–1990). However, simulation without CO2 showed that grain yield will not significantly increase by 2030 s and 2050 s across all the scenarios. Based on the prediction result it can be generalized that chickpea will be benefited from the projected climate changes in northeastern Ethiopia. According to the simulation result application of two supplemental irrigation (flower initiation and pod setting stages) and early sowing significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increase grain yield of chickpea in northeastern Ethiopia under the present and future climate conditions. Selection of appropriate cultivars based on the agroecology of the area has paramount important to increase chickpea productivity under the present and future climate condition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
Evacuation zone modeling under climate change: A data-driven method,"Predetermined evacuation zones can be used to estimate the demand of evacuees, which is helpful in assessing the resilience of transportation systems in the presence of natural disasters. Evacuation zones defined based on current road networks and environmental and demo-economic characteristics of a region cannot remain the same in the future because long-term climate change such as the rise of sea level would have major impacts on hurricane-related risks. Traditional methods for the prediction of future evacuation zones rely heavily on the storm surge models and could be time-consuming and costly to use. This study develops a novel grid cell-based data-driven method that can predict future evacuation zones under climate change without running the expensive storm surge models. The map of Manhattan, which is the central area of New York City, was uniformly split into 45 × 45 m2 grid cells as the basic geographical units of analysis. A decision tree and a random forest were used to capture the relationship between grid cell-specific features, such as geographical features, evacuation mobility, and demo-economic features, and current zone categories that could reflect the risk levels during hurricanes. Tenfold cross validation was used to evaluate model performance and it was found that the random forest outperformed the decision tree in term of the accuracy and kappa statistic. The random forest was used to predict the delineation of evacuation zones in the 2050s and 2090s based on the predicted sea-level rises and changes of demo-economic features. Compared with the current zoning, the areas with a need for evacuation are expected to expand in the future. The proposed method can be used to promptly estimate the future evacuation zones under different sea-level rise scenarios and can provide the convenience to assess transportation system resilience in the context of climate change. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."
A mix-method model for adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector: A case study for Italian wine farms,"The negative effects of climate change are predicted to impact the agricultural sector in coming decades. Economic losses and modifications of production processes are fundamental issues to consider in coping with the harmful consequences of climate variability. The literature and empirical evidence show that the wine sector is extremely vulnerable to this risk. These studies show that this sector lacks appropriate adaptation strategies due to the complexity of the analysed systems and interrelations between a number of socio-economic and environmental variables. The present study designed a decision support system to identify adaptation strategies for wine farms undergoing climate change. The tool allows for the analysis of a wine farm's economic performance when it adopts measures to cope with climatic variability. Average values for climate change and extreme events were considered to assess different scenarios. A mix-method approach was applied to integrate probability calculations, complex system analyses and operational research (a metaheuristic approach). The model was tested on a case study located in central Italy (Chianti Classico). To maintain and improve future financial performance, organic farming and adjustments to procedural guidelines were recommended as key strategies. Economic variables, such as the average price of wine, seem to have a strong influence on farms' implementation of adaptive measures. An additional result seems to suggest that insurance schemes in areas producing high quality wine are only suitable when low-level deductibles and public funding are available. The present work shows that the decision support system favours analytical sensitivity to different scenarios and variables related to climate change as well as to socio-economic shifts in the viticulture sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI): A multidisciplinary risk index for Latin America and the Caribbean,"As the world’s population grows to a projected 11.2 billion by 2100, the number of people living in low-lying areas exposed to coastal hazards is projected to increase. Critical infrastructure and valuable assets continue to be placed in vulnerable areas, and in recent years, millions of people have been displaced by natural hazards. Impacts from coastal hazards depend on the number of people, value of assets, and presence of critical resources in harm’s way. Risks related to natural hazards are determined by a complex interaction between physical hazards, the vulnerability of a society or social-ecological system and its exposure to such hazards. Moreover, these risks are amplified by challenging socioeconomic dynamics, including poorly planned urban development, income inequality, and poverty. This study employs a combination of machine learning clustering techniques (Self Organizing Maps and K-Means) and a spatial index, to assess coastal risks in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) on a comparative scale. The proposed method meets multiple objectives, including the identification of hotspots and key drivers of coastal risk, and the ability to process large-volume multidimensional and multivariate datasets, effectively reducing sixteen variables related to coastal hazards, geographic exposure, and socioeconomic vulnerability, into a single index. Our results demonstrate that in LAC, more than 500,000 people live in areas where coastal hazards, exposure (of people, assets and ecosystems) and poverty converge, creating the ideal conditions for a perfect storm. Hotspot locations of coastal risk, identified by the proposed Comparative Coastal Risk Index (CCRI), contain more than 300,00 people and include: El Oro, Ecuador; Sinaloa, Mexico; Usulutan, El Salvador; and Chiapas, Mexico. Our results provide important insights into potential adaptation alternatives that could reduce the impacts of future hazards. Effective adaptation options must not only focus on developing coastal defenses, but also on improving practices and policies related to urban development, agricultural land use, and conservation, as well as ameliorating socioeconomic conditions. © 2017 Calil et al.

The role of unstructured data in real-time disaster-related social media monitoring,"Social media can be an important, constantly updated, source of information concerning natural disasters. User-generated, free text messages contain useful elements for the three main phases of disaster management: awareness/early warning, response, post-disaster assessments. However, most of the previous research focus on studying contents collected in relation to specific events. More work can be done in extending Information Extraction tasks to continuous streams of documents (potentially) hazard-related, regardless of time or location. We describe a Natural Language Processing architecture, employed in our study, to collect and monitor keyword-based streams, associated to different languages and event types. Starting from existing work, we review the definitions of disaster-related Information Types and Informativeness to better capture relevant and interesting items in the newly defined streams. To act as both a guideline in this procedure and a gold standard in automatic classification we created and annotated a multi-language, multi-hazard corpus of more than 10,000 tweets, sampled from our collected data-streams. We conclude by discussing the methodology behind and the results achieved by rule-based classifiers that we developed using domain and linguistic knowledge. Our approach is found to be viable in performing Information Extraction on generic, hazard-related (but noisy), social media data streams. © 2017 IEEE."
Adapting railways to provide resilience and sustainability,"The reality of anthropogenic climate change is increasingly apparent, with significant implications for railway and other infrastructure networks. As a transport mode with a relatively small environmental impact, rail has a potentially valuable role to play in climate change mitigation. However, this potential can be realised only if railways are adapted to withstand the effects of the increasingly extreme weather associated with climate change. This requirement is widely acknowledged by governments and the railway industry, and the required responses to the specific potential effects of climate change are well known and understood. However, a review of the literature indicates a need for a decision support system to prioritise the interventions required for the adaptation in the face of uncertainty about both the frequency and scale of future extreme weather events and the nature and the levels of future passenger and freight traffic on the railways. This paper proposes a seven-step framework for the classification of the UK railway network, the assessment of the economic value of traffic using the network (and thus the economic costs of weather-related disruption), the identification of appropriate remedial measures and their costs and thus the prioritisation of these measures by means of cost-benefit analysis."
"Drought Modelling Based on Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Algorithms: A Case Study in Queensland, Australia","The search for better climate change adaptation techniques for addressing environmental and economic issues due to changing climate is of paramount interest in the current era. One of the many ways Pacific Island regions and its people get affected is by dry spells and drought events from extreme climates. A drought is simply a prolonged shortage of water supply in an area. The impact of drought varies both temporally and spatially that can be catastrophic for such regions with lack of resources and facilities to mitigate the drought impacts. Therefore, forecasting drought events using predictive models that have practical implications for understanding drought hydrology and water resources management can allow enough time to take appropriate adaption measures. This study investigates the feasibility of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms for prediction of a drought index: Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The purpose of the study was to develop an ANN model to predict the index in two selected regions in Queensland, Australia. The first region, is named as the grassland and the second as the temperate region. The monthly gridded meteorological variables (precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature) that acted as input parameters in ANN model were obtained from Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) for 1915–2013 period. The potential evapotranspiration (PET), calculated using thornthwaite method, was also an input variable, while SPEI was the predictand for the ANN model. The input data were divided into training (80%), validation (10%) and testing (10%) sets. To determine the optimum ANN model, the Levenberg-Marquardt and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-Newton backpropagation algorithms were used for training the ANN network and the tangent sigmoid, logarithmic sigmoid and linear activation algorithms were used for hidden transfer and output functions. The best architecture of input-hidden neuron-output neurons was 4-28-1 and 4-27-1 for grassland and temperate region, respectively. For evaluation and selection of the optimum ANN model, the statistical metrics: Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ), Willmott’s Index of Agreement (d), Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (E), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were employed. The R 2, d, E, RMSE and MAE for optimum ANN models were 0.9839, 0.9909, 0.9838, 0.1338, 0.0882 and 0.9886, 0.9935, 0.9874, 0.1198, 0.0814 for grassland and temperate region, respectively. When prediction errors were analysed, a value of 0.0025 to 0.8224 was obtained for the grassland region, and a value of 0.0113 to 0.6667 was obtained for the temperate region, indicating that the ANN model exhibit a good skill in predicting the monthly SPEI. Based on the evaluation and statistical analysis of the predicted SPEI and its errors in the test period, we conclude that the ANN model can be used as a useful data-driven tool for forecasting drought events. Broadly, the ANN model can be applied for prediction of other climate related variables, and therefore can play a vital role in the development of climate change adaptation and mitigation plans in developed and developing nations, and most importantly, in the Pacific Island Nations where drought events have a detrimental impact on economic development. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."
The Assessment of Sustainability Indexes and Climate Change Impacts on Integrated Water Resource Management,"Integrated water resource management (IWRM) is facing great challenges due to growing uncertainties caused by climate change (CC), rapid socio-economic and technological changes, and population growth. In the present study, we have developed different indices to assess the availability of water using an IWRM approach. These indices evaluate supply to demands, surface availability, groundwater availability, reservoirs, and environmental flow. Moreover, reliability, resilience, and vulnerability were determined. Sustainability index (SI) and sustainability index by groups (SG) were determined based on the five indices (all indices vary from 0 to 1). The impacts of climate change affect surface and groundwater availability, as do the agricultural, urban, and industrial requirements on the different supplies. We used the generalized AQUATOOL Decision Support System Shell (DSSS) to evaluate the IWRM in the Rio Grande Basin (Morelia, México). Various emission scenarios from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were applied to the basin for the years 2015-2039 and 2075-2099. The results indicate increases in agricultural and urban demand, and decreases in surface runoff, as well as groundwater recharge. The proposed indices are useful for different approaches (decision-makers, water policy, and drought risks, among others). CC significantly affects the different proposed indices and indicates a decrease of the SI, SG1, and SG2 (i.e., less availability). For example, we found that SG2 decreased from 0.812 to 0.195 under the RCP 8.5 2075-2099 scenario, and SG2 equal to 0.252 and 0.326 for the RCP 6.0 2075-2099 and RCP 4.5 2070-2099 scenarios, respectively (values close to 0 indicate worst drought conditions). © 2017 by the authors.

Meteorological drought forecasting for ungauged areas based on machine learning: Using long-range climate forecast and remote sensing data,"A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1–6-month lead times at 0.05 × 0.05° resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer’s drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user’s drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer’s accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user’s accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas."
"Vulnerability to climate change of cocoa in West Africa: Patterns, opportunities and limits to adaptation","The West African cocoa belt, reaching from Sierra Leone to southern Cameroon, is the origin of about 70% of the world's cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which in turn is the basis of the livelihoods of about two million farmers. We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario RCP 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas.

"Dynamic decision support for managing regional resources: Mapping risk in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania","To build resilience, communities must redesign standard practices in emergency management training and operations such that stakeholders share a common view of community risks and resources. A shared image of community risks and resources can facilitate engagement of organizations across sectors and jurisdictions in collective action to reduce shared regional risks. Moreover, creating a reliable, trusted knowledge commons or shared knowledge base for information search, exchange, and updating can support cognition and communication among participating actors, a critical task in achieving effective collective action, especially in urgent, complex, and evolving emergency systems and situations. In this article, we present the initial stage of a prototype decision support system for emergency operations in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. This prototype represents the first step in building a shared knowledge based to support community resilience in multi-jurisdictional regional system. Vetted and endorsed by experienced practicing emergency managers in the county, the prototype system uses geospatial modeling to map resource allocation scenarios in relation to various types of risk in the region. By providing a trusted knowledge base of regional risks and resources, the prototype system can support emergency managers in developing an integrated perspective on shared regional risks and in collectively exploring, assessing, and improving the efficaciousness of coordinated inter-organizational and inter-jurisdictional resource allocation strategies in virtual emergency response and readiness scenarios. Dynamic functions are proposed for future development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd"
Development of an England-wide indoor overheating and air pollution model using artificial neural networks,"With the UK climate projected to warm in future decades, there is an increased research focus on the risks of indoor overheating. Energy-efficient building adaptations may modify a buildings risk of overheating and the infiltration of air pollution from outdoor sources. This paper presents the development of a national model of indoor overheating and air pollution, capable of modelling the existing and future building stocks, along with changes to the climate, outdoor air pollution levels, and occupant behaviour. The model presented is based on a large number of EnergyPlus simulations run in parallel. A metamodelling approach is used to create a model that estimates the indoor overheating and air pollution risks for the English housing stock. The performance of neural networks (NNs) is compared to a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm when forming the metamodel. NNs are shown to give almost a 50% better overall performance than SVR. © 2016 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA)."
The Management of Fragile Resources: A Long Term Perspective,"Excessive exploitation diminishes the capacity of natural resources to withstand environmental stress, increasing their vulnerability to extreme conditions that may trigger abrupt changes. The onset of such events depends on the coincidence of random environmental conditions and the resource state (determining its resilience). Examples include species extinction, ecosystem collapse, disease outburst and climate change induced calamities. The policy response to the catastrophic threat is measured in terms of its effect on the long-term behavior of the resource state. To that end, the L-methodology, developed originally to study autonomous systems, is extended to non-autonomous problems involving catastrophic threats. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
A new decision support system to analyse the impacts of climate change on the Hungarian forestry and agricultural sectors,"In this paper, a novel decision support system (DSS) will be introduced, based on geospatial data analyses that we developed for the Hungarian forestry and agricultural sectors. This work was part of a larger research project, whose goal is to evaluate the impacts of projected climate change on forestry and agriculture and to identify potential adaptation options. The proposed DSS integrates various environmental coverages, including topography, vegetation, climate, soils, and hydrology. It also processes time-series data such as meteorological variables. The novelty of the system is its geospatial and geostatistical capability to map species spatial and climate space distribution and yield data using machine learning techniques (Maximum likelihood and Fuzzy logic). The DSS can generate projections, as well as sensitivity and risk assessments, and in this way, it can help to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. The web-based implementation of the DSS allows decision-makers to directly interact with both current and projected geoinformation. The mechanics and the benefits of the DSS will be demonstrated on a Hungarian county where the system was first implemented as a prototype. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
A decision support system for coordinated disaster relief distribution,"This paper presents a simulation and optimization based decision-support system (DSS) to facilitate disaster relief coordination between private and relief organizations. The DSS simulates disasters and plans shipments of relief goods via transfer points to demand points in the affected area. This enables decision-makers to analyze the last-mile distribution of goods by scheduling and routing trucks, off-road as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. Roads which are closed or opened during a disaster are considered allowing a dynamic adaptation to real world conditions and a comprehensive analysis over a rolling time-horizon. A mixed-integer problem formulation, an agent-based simulation, a heuristic-based scheduling and routing procedure as well as a Tabu Search metaheuristic are applied to analyze the given decision problem. Coordination between private and relief organization shows to be especially beneficial if time-losses resulting from closed roads are high and substantial unexpected demand occurs. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of selecting suitable transfer points and the potential of simulation and optimization based DSSs to improve disaster relief distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing weather-yield relationships in rice at local scale using data mining approaches,"Seasonal and inter-annual climate variability have become important issues for farmers, and climate change has been shown to increase them. Simultaneously farmers and agricultural organizations are increasingly collecting observational data about in situ crop performance. Agriculture thus needs new tools to cope with changing environmental conditions and to take advantage of these data. Data mining techniques make it possible to extract embedded knowledge associated with farmer experiences from these large observational datasets in order to identify best practices for adapting to climate variability. We introduce new approaches through a case study on irrigated and rainfed rice in Colombia. Preexisting observational datasets of commercial harvest records were combined with in situ daily weather series. Using Conditional Inference Forest and clustering techniques, we assessed the relationships between climatic factors and crop yield variability at the local scale for specific cultivars and growth stages. The analysis showed clear relationships in the various location-cultivar combinations, with climatic factors explaining 6 to 46% of spatiotemporal variability in yield, and with crop responses to weather being non-linear and cultivar-specific. Climatic factors affected cultivars differently during each stage of development. For instance, one cultivar was affected by high nighttime temperatures in the reproductive stage but responded positively to accumulated solar radiation during the ripening stage. Another was affected by high nighttime temperatures during both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Clustering of the weather patterns corresponding to individual cropping events revealed different groups of weather patterns for irrigated and rainfed systems with contrasting yield levels. Best-suited cultivars were identified for some weather patterns, making weather-site-specific recommendations possible. This study illustrates the potential of data mining for adding value to existing observational data in agriculture by allowing embedded knowledge to be quickly leveraged. It generates site-specific information on cultivar response to climatic factors and supports on-farm management decisions for adaptation to climate variability. © 2016 Delerce et al.

"Decision support for long-range, community-based planning to mitigate against and recover from potential multiple disasters","This paper discusses a new mathematical model for community-driven disaster planning that is intended to help decision makers exploit the synergies resulting from simultaneously considering actions focusing on mitigation and efforts geared toward long-term recovery. The model is keyed on enabling long-term community resilience in the face of potential disasters of varying types, frequencies, and severities, and the approach's highly iterative nature is facilitated by the model's implementation in the context of a decision support system. Three examples from Mombasa, Kenya, East Africa, are discussed and compared in order to demonstrate the advantages of the new mathematical model over the current ad hoc mitigation and long-term recovery planning approaches that are typically used. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

A decision support system to find the best water allocation strategies in a Mediterranean river basin in future scenarios of global change,"Global change refers to climate changes, but also demographic, technological and economic changes. Predicted water scarcity will be critical in the coastal Mediterranean region, especially for provision to mid-sized and large-sized cities. This paper studies the case of the city of Tarragona, located at the Mediterranean area of north-eastern Spain (Catalonia). Several scenarios have been constructed to evaluate different sectorial water allocation policies to mitigate the water scarcity induced by global change. Future water supply and demand predictions have been made for three time spans. The decision support system presented is based on the outranking model, which constructs a partial pre-order based on pairwise preference relations among all the possible actions. The system analyses a hierarchical structure of criteria, including environmental and economic criteria. We compare several adaptation measures including alternative water sources, inter-basin water transfer and sectorial demand management coming from industry, agriculture and domestic sectors. Results indicate that the most appropriate water allocation strategies depend on the severity of the global change effects. © 2015 Taylor and Francis."
DESYCO: A decision support system for the regional risk assessment of climate change impacts in coastal zones,"Several decision support systems were developed in recent years to encourage climate adaptation planning in coastal areas, especially at a national to global scale. However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system).

"Projection of impacts of climate change on windthrows and evaluation of potential adaptation measures in forest management: A case study from empirical modelling of windthrows in Hokkaido, Japan, by Typhoon Songda (2004)","A windthrow refers to the uprooting and overthrowing of trees by the wind. Typhoons are a major cause of windthrows in Japan and are predicted to intensify under global warming. This study aimed to estimate the impact of climate change on windthrows and evaluate possible adaptation measures for sustainable forest management. We incorporated Typhoon Songda (2004) simulation experiments under current and pseudo-global warming (2075–2099, RCP 8.5 scenario) conditions with windthrow modelling in four natural and four artificial (Abies sachalinensis, Pinaceae) forests of Hokkaido. Unexpectedly, pseudo-global warming conditions decreased windthrow probabilities compared with current conditions for both forest types, presumably because wind speeds of the simulated typhoon weakened in Japan’s high-latitude regions. Our results indicate that reconversion of artificial forests into natural forests largely decreased windthrow probability, providing a potential adaptation measure for improved forest management. To fully understand the range of climate-change effects on windthrow in Japan, future studies should use different climate scenarios and data from other typhoons, geographical regions, and forest types. © 2016, Japan Society of Hydrology and Water Resources."

Cross-language domain adaptation for classifying crisis-related short messages,"Rapid crisis response requires real-time analysis of messages. After a disaster happens, volunteers attempt to classify tweets to determine needs, e.g., supplies, infrastructure damage, etc. Given labeled data, supervised machine learning can help classify these messages. Scarcity of labeled data causes poor performance in machine training. Can we reuse old tweets to train classifiers? How can we choose labeled tweets for training? Specifically, we study the usefulness of labeled data of past events. Do labeled tweets in different language help? We observe the performance of our classifiers trained using different combinations of training sets obtained from past disasters. We perform extensive experimentation on real crisis datasets and show that the past labels are useful when both source and target events are of the same type (e.g. both earthquakes). For similar languages (e.g., Italian and Spanish), cross-language domain adaptation was useful, however, when for different languages (e.g., Italian and English), the performance decreased."
A proposal for climate change resilience management through fuzzy controllers,"We aim towards the implementation of a set of fuzzy controllers capable to perform automated estimation of the period of time necessary to recover a resilience level through the non-linear influence of a set of interrelated climate change resilience indicators constrained by social-based variables. This fuzzy controller set, working together with a fuzzy inference system type Mamdani, will be capable to estimate the proper adjustments to be done onto system,s elements in order to achieve a certain resilience level, while a general estimation of required costs is appraised. The final tool can then be used to provide guidelines for strategic vulnerability planning and monitoring through a clear understanding between investments and results, while an open evaluation and scrutiny of applied policies is made. In this paper the main strategy to achieve the mentioned objectives is presented and discussed. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved."
Optimizing resilience in large scale networks,"We propose a decision making framework to optimize the resilience of road networks to natural disasters such as floods. Our model generalizes an existing one for this problem by allowing roads with a broad class of stochastic delay models. We then present a fast algorithm based on the sample average approximation (SAA) method and network design techniques to solve this problem approximately. On a small existing benchmark, our algorithm produces near-optimal solutions and the SAA method converges quickly with a small number of samples.We then apply our algorithm to a large real-world problem to optimize the resilience of a road network to failures of stream crossing structures to minimize travel times of emergency medical service vehicles. On medium-sized networks, our algorithm obtains solutions of comparable quality to a greedy baseline method but is 30-60 times faster. Our algorithm is the only existing algorithm that can scale to the full network, which has many thousands of edges. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Our hearts go out: social support and gratitude after disaster,"Disasters have devastating effects on communities, which struggle to recover without sufficient social support. This exploratory study uses Twitter as a lens for examining gratitude for support provisions in the aftermath of disasters. Gratitude for support is examined in the context of two major disasters in the United States, the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and a May 2011 tornado that devastated Alabama. Analyzing tweets from these communities after each disaster, we identified and described six categories of support exchanged through Twitter. We found distinct difference in expressions of gratitude for different types of social support in these two communities. While some of these differences could be expected based on the nature of the disaster, others were less predictable. These findings suggest that social media has value as a window into real-time community behaviors relating to response and healing after disaster, and may offer potential for monitoring community resilience and recovery, and provide insights for disaster mental health provision,"
"Detecting climate adaptation with mobile network data in Bangladesh: anomalies in communication, mobility and consumption patterns during cyclone ...","Large-scale data from digital infrastructure, like mobile phone networks, provides rich information on the behavior of millions of people in areas affected by climate stress. Using anonymized data on mobility and calling behavior from 5.1 million Grameenphone users in Barisal Division and Chittagong District, Bangladesh, we investigate the effect of Cyclone Mahasen, which struck Barisal and Chittagong in May 2013. We characterize spatiotemporal patterns and anomalies in calling frequency, mobile recharges, and population movements before, during and after the cyclone. While it was originally anticipated that the analysis might detect mass evacuations and displacement from coastal areas in the weeks following the storm, no evidence was found to suggest any permanent changes in population distributions. We detect anomalous patterns of mobility both around the time of early warning messages and the storm’s landfall, showing where and when mobility occurred as well as its characteristics. We find that anomalous patterns of mobility and calling frequency correlate with rainfall intensity (r = .75, p < 0.05) and use calling frequency to construct a spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone impact as the storm moves across the affected region. Likewise, from mobile recharge purchases we show the spatiotemporal patterns in people’s preparation for the storm in vulnerable areas. In addition to demonstrating how anomaly detection can be useful for modeling human adaptation to climate extremes, we also identify several promising avenues for future improvement of disaster planning and response activities."
AUTOFLOW© - A novel application for water resource management and climate change response using smart technology,"Urban areas are increasingly at risk from climate change, with negative impacts predicted for human health, the economy and ecosystems. These risks require responses from cities to improve their resilience. Several analysis platforms have been developed worldwide to help effectively control and response to these impacts from different angles, including water resources management, energy production and consumption management, air pollution control, or other natural resources management. To contribute to this goal, Griffith University in Australia has developed Autoflow©, a smart application for water demand analysis and carbon emission monitoring and prediction. Various advanced mathematical models have been embedded into this system, from machine learning and pattern recognition techniques for water end use analysis, to Dynamic Harmonic Regression, Kalman Filter and Fixed interval smooth algorithms for water demand forecasting. Once being deployed, Autoflow© will be an effective environmental management tool that can: (i) provide water utilities and water consumers with detailed real-time information on how, when, where water has been consumed (e.g. shower event at 11:23:35 AM or clothes washer at 4:00:15 PM on Monday 11/12/2014),(ii) perform water demand forecasting at end-use level (e.g. expected 1.5 mega litres of shower consumption from 6pm - 7m in suburb A tomorrow), (iii) real-time monitor and predict carbon emission level from water consumption (e.g. Property A: Carbon emission from 6am-6pm tomorrow is 12.4kg), and (iv) suggest options for reducing water consumption and carbon emission. © 2016 Environmental Modelling and Software for Supporting a Sustainable Future, Proceedings - 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, iEMSs 2016.

A novel case adaptation method based on an improved integrated genetic algorithm for power grid wind disaster emergencies,"We proposed a novel case adaptation method for wind disaster emergency of power grid.This method improved adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm in performance.We improved frame theory in incomplete information with evidence theory.This method could be chose as a new method for expanding case base. Case adaptation is a challenging and crucial process of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for power grid wind disaster emergencies. The statistical adaptation method is a traditional method that is independent of domain knowledge, is easy to implement, but is not proper for the complex system problem. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a novel case adaptation method to address this problem by integrating the multi-objective genetic algorithm with gray relational analysis, called the grey relational analysis-multi-objective genetic algorithms method (GRAMOGA). Compared with the traditional method, GRAMOGA is performed in terms of corresponding relations between the case similarity and emergency plan, indicating a new idea for case adaptation. To improve adaptation accuracy, this paper improved the multi-objective genetic algorithm by using a selection method based on the fitness function. Furthermore, the frame theory is expanded by combining it with the D/S evidence theory, providing a novel method for case description and retrieval with incomplete information. A practical example from the south of Jiangsu demonstrates that GRAMOGA achieves better adaptation performance for power grid wind disaster emergencies. In addition to the practical applications in case adaptation, GRAMOGA can be used as a novel method for expanding the case base."
Adaptation to climate change: The impacts of optimized planting dates on attainable maize yields under rainfed conditions in Burkina Faso,"The high intra-seasonal rainfall variability and the lack of adaptive capacities are the major limiting factors for rainfed agricultural production in smallholder farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the crop planting date, a low-cost agricultural management strategy aiming to alleviate crop water stress can contribute to enhance agricultural decision-making, particularly as a climate change adaptation strategy. By considering the crop water requirements throughout the crop growing cycle using a process-based crop model in conjunction with a fuzzy rule-based planting date approach, location-specific planting rules were derived for maize cropping in Burkina Faso (BF). Then, they were applied to regional future climate projections to derive optimized planting dates (OPDs) for the 2020s (2011–2030) and the 2040s (2031–2050), respectively. Based on potential maize yield simulations driven by climate change projections and planting dates, the OPD approach was compared with a well-established planting date method for West Africa and evaluated as a potential adaptation strategy for climate change. On average, the OPD approach achieved approximately +15% higher potential maize yield regardless of the regional climate model (RCM) and the period. However, the potential yield surpluses strongly decreased from the North to the South. Regarding climate change adaptation, the combined impact of climate change and the OPD approach has shown on average, a mean maize yield deviation between −23% and 34% in comparison to the 1989–2008 baseline period. Yield deviation is found to depend strongly on the RCM and location. The RCM ensemble mean yield for the period 2011–2050 revealed a maximum decrease of 8% compared to the baseline period. On the one hand, these findings highlight the potential of the OPDs as a crop management strategy but, on the other hand, it is apparent that farmers need to combine the OPDs with others suited farming practices to adequately respond to climate change."
Twitter Mining for Disaster Response: A Domain Adaptation Approach,"Microblogging data such as Twitter data contains valuable information that has the potential to help improve the speed, quality, and efficiency of disaster response. Machine learning can help with this by prioritizing the tweets with respect to various classification criteria. However, supervised learning algorithms require labeled data to learn accurate classifiers. Unfortunately, for a new disaster, labeled tweets are not easily available, while they are usually available for previous disasters. Furthermore, unlabeled tweets from the current disaster are accumulating fast. We study the usefulness of labeled data from a prior source disaster, together with unlabeled data from the current target disaster to learn domain adaptation classifiers for the target. Experimental results suggest that, for some tasks, source data itself can be useful for classifying target data. However, for tasks specific to a particular disaster, domain adaptation approaches that use target unlabeled data in addition to source labeled data are superior. "
Multiclass classification of agro-ecological zones for Arabica coffee: an improved understanding of the impacts of climate change,"Cultivation of Coffea arabica is highly sensitive to and has been shown to be negatively impacted by progressive climatic changes. Previous research contributed little to support forward-looking adaptation. Agro-ecological zoning is a common tool to identify homologous environments and prioritize research. We demonstrate here a pragmatic approach to describe spatial changes in agro-climatic zones suitable for coffee under current and future climates. We defined agro-ecological zones suitable to produce arabica coffee by clustering geo-referenced coffee occurrence locations based on bio-climatic variables. We used random forest classification of climate data layers to model the spatial distribution of these agro-ecological zones. We used these zones to identify spatially explicit impact scenarios and to choose locations for the long-term evaluation of adaptation measures as climate changes. We found that in zones currently classified as hot and dry, climate change will impact arabica more than those that are better suited to it. Research in these zones should therefore focus on expanding arabica's environmental limits. Zones that currently have climates better suited for arabica will migrate upwards by about 500m in elevation. In these zones the up-slope migration will be gradual, but will likely have negative ecosystem impacts. Additionally, we identified locations that with high probability will not change their climatic characteristics and are suitable to evaluate C. arabica germplasm in the face of climate change. These locations should be used to investigate long term adaptation strategies to production systems."
An end-to-end assessment of extreme weather impacts on food security,"Both governments and the private sector urgently require better estimates of the likely incidence of extreme weather events, their impacts on food crop production and the potential consequent social and economic losses. Current assessments of climate change impacts on agriculture mostly focus on average crop yield vulnerability to climate and adaptation scenarios. Also, although new-generation climate models have improved and there has been an exponential increase in available data, the uncertainties in their projections over years and decades, and at regional and local scale, have not decreased. We need to understand and quantify the non-stationary, annual and decadal climate impacts using simple and communicable risk metrics that will help public and private stakeholders manage the hazards to food security. Here we present an 'end-to-end' methodological construct based on weather indices and machine learning that integrates current understanding of the various interacting systems of climate, crops and the economy to determine short- to long-term risk estimates of crop production loss, in different climate and adaptation scenarios. For provinces north and south of the Yangtze River in China, we have found that risk profiles for crop yields that translate climate into economic variability follow marked regional patterns, shaped by drivers of continental-scale climate. We conclude that to be cost-effective, region-specific policies have to be tailored to optimally combine different categories of risk management instruments. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited."
Large-scale disaster response management: Social media and homeland security,"This chapter provides readers with an overview of how social media has enhanced large-scale natural disaster response at the Department of Homeland Security and its partners. The authors of this chapter present the history of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and how its successes and failures have shaped how the Department of Homeland Security has managed trends in increased community participation and information technology. Concepts from Systems Engineering frame the discussion around resilience engineering, network analysis, information systems, and human systems integration as they pertain to how social media can be integrated more effectively in large-scale disaster response. Examples of social media in disaster response are presented including a more in-depth case study on the use of social media during the 2012 Hurricane Sandy response. The chapter concludes with a proposed framework of a decision support system which integrates the benefits of social media while mitigating its risks. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved."
An integrated crop model and GIS decision support system for assisting agronomic decision making under climate change,"The semi-arid tropical (SAT) regions of India are suffering from low productivity which may be further aggravated by anticipated climate change. The present study analyzes the spatial variability of climate change impacts on groundnut yields in the Anantapur district of India and examines the relative contribution of adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a web based decision support tool that integrates crop simulation model and Geographical Information System (GIS) was developed to assist agronomic decision making and this tool can be scalable to any location and crop. The climate change projections of five global climate models (GCMs) relative to the 1980-2010 baseline for Anantapur district indicates an increase in rainfall activity to the tune of 10.6 to 25% during Mid-century period (2040-69) with RCP 8.5. The GCMs also predict warming exceeding 1.4 to 2.4. °C by 2069 in the study region. The spatial crop responses to the projected climate indicate a decrease in groundnut yields with four GCMs (MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC5, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES) and a contrasting 6.3% increase with the GCM, GFDL-ESM2M. The simulation studies using CROPGRO-Peanut model reveals that groundnut yields can be increased on average by 1.0%, 5.0%, 14.4%, and 20.2%, by adopting adaptation options of heat tolerance, drought tolerant cultivars, supplemental irrigation and a combination of drought tolerance cultivar and supplemental irrigation respectively. The spatial patterns of relative benefits of adaptation options were geographically different and the greatest benefits can be achieved by adopting new cultivars having drought tolerance and with the application of one supplemental irrigation at 60. days after sowing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
Coping with climate change: The role of spatial decision support tools in facilitating community adaptation,"Climate change challenges communities to visualize spatial patterns of risk, assess their vulnerability to those risks, and prepare adaptation plans to lower vulnerability. This paper outlines the design and implementation of a prototype web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), referred to as the Community Adaptation Viewer (CAV), to assist adaptation planning. Thin-client, Javascript enabled web-SDSS software was constructed to allow interaction with urban infrastructure, and support ""on-the-fly"" assessment of social and economic vulnerability. Facilitated, decision-making workshops were conducted with small groups of stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The test case illustrates that high levels of information integration are practical to achieve, and that the SDSS can significantly enhance the ability of communities to conduct elaborate, geographically-specific climate change adaptation planning. Given the long time frame required to fulfil some adaptation plans, it is crucial that communities begin to develop and invest in adaptation strategies as soon as possible. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."
A bitter cup: climate change profile of global production of Arabica and Robusta coffee,"Coffee has proven to be highly sensitive to climate change. Because coffee plantations have a lifespan of about thirty years, the likely effects of future climates are already a concern. Forward-looking research on adaptation is therefore in high demand across the entire supply chain. In this paper we seek to project current and future climate suitability for coffee production (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora) on a global scale. We used machine learning algorithms to derive functions of climatic suitability from a database of geo-referenced production locations. Use of several parameter combinations enhances the robustness of our analysis. The resulting multi-model ensemble suggests that higher temperatures may reduce yields of C. arabica, while C. canephora could suffer from increasing variability of intra-seasonal temperatures. Climate change will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50 % across emission scenarios. Impacts are highest at low latitudes and low altitudes. Impacts at higher altitudes and higher latitudes are still negative but less pronounced. The world’s dominant production regions in Brazil and Vietnam may experience substantial reductions in area available for coffee. Some regions in East Africa and Asia may become more suitable, but these are partially in forested areas, which could pose a challenge to mitigation efforts. © 2014, The Author(s)."
Climate change and transformability scenario evaluation for venice (Italy) port-city through ANP method,"The paper explores the consequences of resilience loss in some social- ecological components of Venice port-city in Italy and suggests integrated sustainable strategies on increasing their stress response capability. The urban model of Venice depends on two influential factors: the natural balance between land and water, and the social-economic dependence between mainland and islands. The authors adopt a broad framework of urban spaces and water environment, considering Venice as a complex regional unit, highly dynamic and sensitive. The adaptive balance historically reached by population and nature in Venice has been altered, because of a non-sustainable economic expansion, and tourism policy. The paper adopts a multi-dimensional approach, integrating the cognitive and evaluative dimensions with the technical and economic ones, in order to define possible strategies of action through Multi- Criteria Analysis and ANP method, able to play a strategic role in enhancing resilience at various scale. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."
A decision support system for robust humanitarian facility location,"Each year, more than 400 natural disasters hit the world. To be more responsive, humanitarians organize stocks of relief items. It is an issue to know the quantity of items to be stored and where they should be positioned. Many authors have tried to address this issue both in industrial and humanitarian environments. However, humanitarian supply chains today do not perform correctly, particularly as regards resilience and efficiency. This is mainly due to the fact that when a disaster occurs, some hazards can strongly impact the network by destroying some resources or collapsing infrastructure. The expected performance of the relief response is consequently strongly decreased. The problem statement of our research work consists in proposing a decision-making support model in artificial intelligence dedicated to the humanitarian world and capable of designing a coherent network that is still able to adequately manage the response to a disaster despite failures or inadequacies of infrastructure and potential resources. This contribution is defined through a Stochastic Multi-Scenarios Program as a core and a set of extensions. A real-life application case based on the design of a humanitarian supply chain in Peru is developed in order to highlight the benefits and limits of the proposition. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."
Response and recovery after severe wind storms using hierarchical open vehicle routing,"This research represents a novel application of operations research methodology to a form of a hierarchical open vehicle routing problem. In our case study, a road network was divided into priority sets such that each set needed to be completely addressed before work could begin on the next. Rule-based heuristics and adaptations of local beam search heuristics were tested in various combinations, viable solutions were developed, and results were evaluated based on the time required to clear the entire road network of storm-generated debris. The results were also compared against a theoretical lower bound on the time required to clear all roads. The best routes were generated using a combination of constant time beam search and a rule-based heuristic, 12.4% greater than the lower bound, yet understandable for the case study area that contained numerous dead-ends and disconnected road priority sets.

Coupling virtual watersheds with ecosystem services assessment: a 21st century platform to support river research and management,"The demand for freshwater is projected to increase worldwide over the coming decades, resulting in severe water stress and threats to riverine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and services. A major societal challenge is to determine where environmental changes will have the greatest impacts on riverine ecosystem services and where resilience can be incorporated into adaptive resource planning. Both water managers and scientists need new integrative tools to guide them toward the best solutions that meet the demands of a growing human population but also ensure riverine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Resource planners and scientists could better address a growing set of riverine management and risk mitigation issues by (1) using a 'virtual watersheds' approach based on improved digital river networks and better connections to terrestrial systems, (2) integrating virtual watersheds with ecosystem services technology (ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services: ARIES), and (3) incorporating the role of riverine biotic interactions in shaping ecological responses. This integrative platform can support both interdisciplinary scientific analyses of pressing societal issues and effective dissemination of findings across river research and management communities. It should also provide new integrative tools to identify the best solutions and trade-offs to ensure the conservation of riverine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

"Managed aquifer recharge as a key element in Sonora River basin management, Mexico","Arid regions frequently have competing demands for scarce water mainly for urban supply and irrigation. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) as an instrument to find the optimal scheme for management of water resources from multiple supplies using managed aquifer recharge (MAR). The DSS capabilities are demonstrated through its application to the Sonora River basin. The watershed is located in Northern Mexico and has a wide variety of agricultural zones and many small towns along the river. The most important urban center is the city of Hermosillo with a concentrated water demand for urban and industrial uses. The DSS includes the hydrological modeling of the entire system, stream flow in rivers, the groundwater-flow model including MAR, and the characterization of the water quality from various sources. The result from this study establishes that it will be difficult to satisfy the increasing demand for water using the current supply-and-demand-allocation schemes. Alternative sources are thus needed to mitigate the future difference between supply and demand. The MAR with treated wastewater represents an option that could sustain development of urban water supply and irrigation within this basin. It is concluded that the best strategy (least groundwater-storage depletion) is to restrict irrigation and allocate all the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to recharge the aquifer through infiltration lagoons. However, if there is not a limitation to irrigation, urban demand increases at 1.7% per year and without artificial recharge, the aquifers will be depleted in 25 years. Alternatively, if the WWTP effluent is shared between agriculture and MAR, it is possible to allow irrigation of 2,800 ha with small groundwater depletion. The DDS also allows for studying the potential improvements in water quality and resilience to global climate change. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers."
AIDR: Artificial intelligence for disaster response,"We present AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response), a platform designed to perform automatic classification of crisis-related microblog communications. AIDR enables humans and machines to work together to apply human intelligence to large-scale data at high speed. The objective of AIDR is to classify messages that people post during disasters into a set of user-defined categories of information (e.g., ""needs"", ""damage"", etc.) For this purpose, the system continuously ingests data from Twitter, processes it (i.e., using machine learning classification techniques) and leverages human-participation (through crowdsourcing) in real-time. AIDR has been successfully tested to classify informative vs. non-informative tweets posted during the 2013 Pakistan Earthquake. Overall, we achieved a classification quality (measured using AUC) of 80%. AIDR is available at http://aidr.qcri.org/."
Resilience aspects in the sensor web infrastructure for natural disaster monitoring and risk assessment based on earth observation data,"This paper focuses on enabling resilience of the Sensor Web system for disaster monitoring and risk assessment that is based on the use of Earth Observation (EO) data. Resilience is the ability of the system to maintain trustworthy service delivery in spite of changes. Resilience of the EO infrastructure becomes an extremely important issue, especially in the disaster management domain. We propose to enable resilience through: 1) the use of grid resources and services to meet high performance computing requirements; and 2) assessment of resource reputation to select reliable resources. Grid services enable redundancy through integration of heterogeneous resources administrated by geographically distributed organizations. The same services could be provided by different organizations within the infrastructure, and could be of different levels of quality. Therefore, we propose to incorporate a utility-based reputation model to assess reliability of the resources. The proposed approach is implemented within the Namibia Sensor Web Pilot Project that was created as a testbed for evaluating and prototyping key technologies for rapid acquisition and distribution of data products for decision support systems to monitor floods. © 2008-2012 IEEE."
Designing a decision support system for disaster management and recovery,"Returning to basic function and then to normalcy is important after a disaster. This level of resilience allows businesses to reopen, social and emergency services to act quickly and effectively in aiding citizens, and returns a feeling of safety and comfort to those affected. Unfortunately, those tasked with responding and managing the disaster are often overwhelmed and their decision-making taxed, causing the response itself to be inefficient. One way to aid disaster response teams is the introduction of a decision support system (DSS) to support decision making capabilities in time-critical situations. The purpose of this research was to create a framework for disaster recovery and a prototype DSS to aid both command center workers and those in the field. Our goal was to help make response easier and more efficient, as well as evaluate our prototype design for usability. Copyright 2014 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."
"Developing GIS decision support to stakeholders on agricultural land use planning in HA Tinh Province, Vietnam","Land use planning in Vietnam has been conducted but still insufficient for many years. In rural areas, it has been predominantly relying on assessing the suitability of soil for agricultural production. Besides, the planning has extensively incorporated statistics. The current rapid economic growth of Vietnam during its economic transition has increased the pressure on land and water resources which leads to a necessity to adjust the approach to land use planning in order to support the economic growth of the country and provide a framework to manage the development in a sustainable manner. There is a need to have a closer alignment between socio-economic development plans, the overall environmental strategy and the land use plans. Therefore, the role of land use planning must be broaden through taking into account environmental, socio-economic parameters as well as involving different stakeholders who are affected by changes in land use. It is necessary to have a tool to support policy makers and planners in developing, appraising, and selecting planning scenarios which collaborate different social, economic, and environmental development dimensions in order to gain sustainable development goals. Information that have been collected including land use and management by applying Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to stakeholders activities in relationship with land use planning. Informatics and mathematical modeling techniques have been used in data processing, optimal solution determining and information providing for making decision support. The Decision Support System (DSS) providing tools for planners, policy makers and other stakeholders to improve policies on land use planning and implementation of other rural development and land resource management programs with adaptation to climate change."
Enhancing community resilience: Optimal capacity building for expediting post disaster recovery,"The impact of a natural disaster in a region is escalated by lack of capacities including infrastructure serviceability levels and inadequate vital resources required for recovery. Often, existing capacities are unable to support post disaster recovery in different phases, i.e., emergency, short term recovery or restoration and long term recovery. For example, serviceability of the transportation network in Haiti after the earthquake significantly reduced and impeded both the first emergency response teams and the supply of international aid. The hospitals were not able to efficiently treat survivors due to lack of utility services such as water, electricity and also vital resources such as medical supplies, hospital beds, and medical equipment. This increased the severity of impact and delayed the recovery period of the community. The overall restoration and reconstruction of the community slowed down which delayed the return of the community to pre disaster levels within the desired time. Therefore, there is a need to assess the gap in existing capacities of communities required during the disaster response period for mitigating the specific demands arising in different phases. Additionally, decision makers should be able to develop short term and long term strategies for building capacities and enhancing resilience. This research presents a framework of a decision support system (DSS) that will enable decision makers to i) identify the gap in existing capacities of the community, ii) optimize various options available for filling the gap, and iii) develop short term and long term strategies for enhancing resilience. The framework is based on the interrelationship between community recovery and capacities of six types of infrastructure, i.e., civil, civic, social, financial, environmental and educational. Optimal solutions could be identified by considering the tradeoffs between capacity building and enhancing resilience, costs and time involved, and ability of the options to minimize the severity of impact."
A hierarchical decision support system to evaluate the effects of climate change in water supply in a Mediterranean river basin,"This paper presents a study of the applicability and suitability of ELECTRE-III-H for evaluating sectorial water allocation policies for a water stressed Mediterranean area of Northeastern Spain (Tarragona). Proposed method is based on the outranking model of decision support systems which constructs a partial preorder based on pairwise preference relations among all the possible actions. This work has addressed the multi-criteria water management problem considering several water allocation strategies to mitigate water scarcity induced by climate change. We compare several adaptation measures including alternative water sources, inter basin water transfer and sectorial demand management coming from industry, agriculture and domestic sectors."
Improving resource allocation for disaster operations management in a multi-hazard context,"The initial impact of a disaster can lead to a variety of associated hazards. By taking a multi-hazard viewpoint with respect to disaster response and recovery, there is an opportunity to allocate limited resources more effectively, particularly in the context of long-term planning for community sustainability. This working paper introduces an approach for extending quantitative resource allocation models to consider multiple interrelated hazards. The discussion is motivated by a literature review of existing models and then focuses on changes necessary to take the multiplicity of hazards into consideration in the context of decision support systems for disaster operations management."
Global climate change adaptation priorities for biodiversity and food security,"International policy is placing increasing emphasis on adaptation to climate change, including the allocation of new funds to assist adaptation efforts. Climate change adaptation funding may be most effective where it meets integrated goals, but global geographic priorities based on multiple development and ecological criteria are not well characterized. Here we show that human and natural adaptation needs related to maintaining agricultural productivity and ecosystem integrity intersect in ten major areas globally, providing a coherent set of international priorities for adaptation funding. An additional seven regional areas are identified as worthy of additional study. The priority areas are locations where changes in crop suitability affecting impoverished farmers intersect with changes in ranges of restricted-range species. Agreement among multiple climate models and emissions scenarios suggests that these priorities are robust. Adaptation funding directed to these areas could simultaneously address multiple international policy goals, including poverty reduction, protecting agricultural production and safeguarding ecosystem services."
Analysing urban resilience through alternative stormwater management options: Application of the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System model at the neighbourhood scale,"Recent changes in cities and their environments, caused by rapid urbanisation and climate change, have increased both flood probability and the severity of flooding. Consequently, there is a need for all cities to adapt to climate and socio-economic changes by developing new strategies for flood risk management. Following a risk paradigm shift from traditional to more integrated approaches, and considering the uncertainties of future urban development, one of the main emerging tasks for city managers becomes the development of resilient cities. However, the meaning of the resilience concept and its operability is still not clear. The goal of this research is to study how urban engineering and design disciplines can improve resilience to floods in urban neighbourhoods. This paper presents the conceptual Spatial Decision Support System (DS3) model which we consider a relevant tool to analyse and then implement resilience into neighbourhood design. Using this model, we analyse and discuss alternative stormwater management options at the neighbourhood scale in two specific areas: Rotterdam and New Orleans. The results obtained demonstrate that the DS3 model confirmed in its framework analysis that stormwater management systems can positively contribute to the improved flood resilience of a neighbourhood. © IWA Publishing 2013."
Involve to improve: A participatory approach for a Decision Support System for coastal climate change impacts assessment. The North Adriatic case,"Decision Support Systems (DSS) are considered innovative tools to cope with climate change related issues and support decision-makers in a sustainable management of natural resources and in the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and adaptation plans. Involving DSS end users since the beginning of the development of a DSS is recognised as fundamental in order to design a tool that can meet stakeholders needs. However, from the analysis of the risk based DSSs at the regional and/or local scale, emerges a lack of application of participatory approaches, despite their acknowledged relevance to the current scientific literature and regulations. Accordingly, in order to respond to the needs of the DSS end users (i.e. public institutions dealing with coastal management and administration), this paper describes the development of a participative approach for a DSS named DESYCO, aimed at the assessment of climate change related impacts and risks on natural and human systems. The participative approach was carried out by means of the integration of participative moments in the DESYCO framework, the identification of potential end users through a preliminary stakeholder analysis and finally the design, administration and analysis of a questionnaire addressed to the end users identified in the case study area of the North Adriatic Italian coast.37 potential DSS end users for the case study were identified and addressed by a survey investigating their knowledge about climate change impacts on coastal zone, ICZM strategy and implementation, DSS functionalities. The questionnaire allowed to gain information that both confirmed the validity of the methodology choices of DESYCO and supplied some useful contribution to the selection of further stakeholders. From the results it emerges a lack of knowledge about ICZM and climate change issues. Moreover public institutions ask for short time frame hazard scenarios while the DSS, depending on the available information supplied by models, focuses especially on long term scenarios. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."
Dynamic Bayesian Networks as a Decision Support tool for assessing Climate Change impacts on highly stressed groundwater systems,"Bayesian Networks (BNs) are powerful tools for assessing and predicting consequences of water management scenarios and uncertain drivers like climate change, integrating available scientific knowledge with the interests of the multiple stakeholders. However, among their major limitations, the non-transient treatment of the cause-effect relationship stands out. A Decision Support System (DSS) based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is proposed here aimed to palliate that limitation through time slicing technique. The DSS comprises several classes (Object-Oriented BN networks), especially designed for future 5. years length time steps (time slices), covering a total control period of 30. years (2070-2100). The DSS has been developed for assessing impacts generated by different Climate Change (CC) scenarios (generated from several Regional Climatic Models (RCMs) under two emission scenarios, A1B and A2) in an aquifer system (Serral-Salinas) affected by intensive groundwater use over the last 30. years. A calibrated continuous water balance model was used to generate hydrological CC scenarios, and then a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) was employed in order to analyze the aquifer behavior under CC conditions. Results obtained from both models were used as input for the DSS, considering rainfall, aquifer recharge, variation of piezometric levels and temporal evolution of aquifer storage as the main hydrological components of the aquifer system. Results show the evolution of the aquifer storage for each future time step under different climate change conditions and under controlled water management interventions. This type of applications would allow establishing potential adaptation strategies for aquifer systems as the CC comes into effect. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."
Rapidmap - Rapid mapping and information dissemination for disasters using remote sensing and geoinformation,"This paper will present the project RAPIDMAP. The project is part of CONCERT-Japan, an ERA-NET initiative funded through the FP7 INCO project frame for enhancing research cooperation between European countries and Japan on two topics, one of which is Resilience Against Disasters. The project started in June 2013 and has a duration of 2 years. In the paper, we will outline the aims of the project, methodologies and techniques to be developed and some test data. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) are powerful technologies for collecting useful information on the damages of disasters in short time. However, since many different types of RS data are available (satellite, aerial, UAV, terrestrial), data co-registration, information integration and feature extraction need reliable and advanced methodologies. In the RAPIDMAP project, we will develop practical ways to integrate RS data processing tools in near-real-time and allow users to use this data soon after the disasters by means of WebGIS tools. This will help not only decision makers but also end-users in the disaster area. The key components of this project are: (1) Near-real-time monitoring: the procedure of near-real-time monitoring with satellites as well as Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAV) will be set up and demonstrated. (2) Data co-registration: in disasters, various images as well as maps come from different sources. The co-registration of multiple images is a key technology for information integration. In this project, a system to co-register multiple images in near-real-time will be developed. (3) Data fusion and change detection: one of the advantages of RS is to collect information with multiple sensors. Various methods for fusing optical with active microwave (SAR) sensor data for information extraction and change detection will be developed. (4) Decision Support System (DSS) based on WebGIS technologies: the collected and integrated information has to be easily accessible and visible by decision makers and end-users in near-real-time and worldwide. By using WebGIS technologies, wireless networks and portable terminals, a DSS will allow easy access, retrieval and visualization of all information (fused data, images, maps, etc.) in very short time after data collection and processing. The project will be practically tested and demonstrated at the Tohoku area in Japan and another test site, which were recently affected by large disasters."
An approach to support decision-making in disaster management based on volunteer geographic information (VGI) and spatial decision support systems (SDSS),"The damage caused by recent events in Japan in 2011 and USA in 2012 highlighted the need to adopt measures to increase the resilience of communities against extreme events and disasters. In addition to the conventional and official information that is necessary for adaptation to disasters, recently, common citizens residents in the affected areas also began contributing with voluntary qualified and updated information. In this context, this work-in-progress presents an approach that uses voluntary information - Also known by VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) - As a data source for Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) in order to assist the decision-making in disaster management. Our approach consists of a framework that integrates voluntary and conventional data, a SDSS and processes and methods for decision-making. As a result, it is expected that this approach will assist official organizations in disaster management by providing mechanisms and information."
Resilience against disasters using Remote Sensing and geoinformation technologies for rapid mapping and information dissemination(RAPIDMAP),"Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) are powerful technologies for collecting useful information on the damages of disasters in short period of time.

Global technology trends: Perspectives from IBM Research Australia on resilient systems,"In an ever more interconnected world, system failures tend to not stay localised but spread through the interconnects. Making systems and processes more resilient becomes an increasingly important problem. During emergencies, this is even more critical as additional failures of information systems further hamper an already stressed situation. Information is crucial for the management of emergencies and the development of resilient next generation decision support platform becomes paramount. We approach the problem from a systems and a development perspective, the exploration of how such a concept translates into socio-technical decision support systems that are more resilient constitutes an important theoretical aspect that needs to be addressed. The research has the following goals: 1) to identify principles for resilient information systems; 2) to define a methodology that provides guidance for architectural work and assessment of architectural design from a resilience standpoint; 3) to evaluate the application of these principles in the case of emergency management.

Assessment of climate change impact on viticulture: economic evaluations and adaptation strategies analysis for the Tuscan wine sector,"Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on various economic sectors (IPCC, 2007) but an especially large one on agriculture because animal and crop growth are heavily influenced by weather conditions during their life cycles. In this paper, a multidisciplinary approach is developed that jointly uses economic and bio-climate models to evaluate the impact of climate change on viticulture in Tuscany (central Italy). Then a model is used to evaluate the likelihood of adoption of various adaptation strategies."
Improving resilience of critical infrastructure systems postdisaster: Recovery and Mitigation,"The nation's capacity for maintenance and improvement of infrastructure systems and its ability to maintain and improve infrastructure systems and ensure the continued service of critical infrastructure systems are receiving special attention because recent disasters have had a significant impact on critical infrastructure. These critical infrastructure systems are the foundation of the nation's economic and social systems. Much research and many policy studies have been conducted to develop methods to improve protection of critical infrastructure with a focus on decreased vulnerability. This paper describes the development of a framework for a decision support system. The objective of the decision support system is to reduce the vulnerability of places and infrastructure systems through the use of mitigation strategies that increase system resilience and resistance to the stresses imposed by disasters. The decision support system will also provide an understanding of the many variables involved in developing strategies to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure systems. This decision support system, referred to as the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Decision Support System (CIR-DSS), uses systems dynamics and recognizes the impacts of disasters, including damage and disruption to critical infrastructure. Results include those of risk and cost-benefit analyses of alternative strategies that also recognize U.S. government policies for recovery and mitigation. A case study focused on transportation infrastructure was used to test and validate the CIR-DSS framework."
Resilience-driven disaster management of civil infrastructure,"After the occurrence of a natural (e.g. earthquake, hurricane, flood, fire) or technological (e.g. explosion, terrorist attack) extreme event, the distributed infrastructure systems and their individual structural components are likely to be significantly damaged. For the emergency response and the quick socio-economic recovery of the region, transportation networks, lifelines, and infrastructure in general play a role of utmost importance. For this reason, the so called ""disaster management"" has always to be focused on restoring as quickly as possible the proper functionality of the infrastructure under limited financial resources and other logistic constraints. The main focus of the present paper is to address this problem and provide a general framework to assist the decision making process in these critical situations. In fact, the main issue in these scenarios is to have a practical and robust way to collect and analyze data with a fast and reliable tool that can lead to quick but informed decisions. Several decision support systems for emergency and/or disaster management have been proposed in the last decades. The proposed approach is based on the holistic concept of resilience, which is gaining momentum as metric for the evaluation of the efficiency of the restoration activities. Resilience is used in this paper as one of the optimization criteria for the rehabilitation planning. An illustrative example is presented to clarify the applicability of the proposed approach to transportation networks."
Developing an inventory-based prioritization methodology for assessing inoperability and economic loss in interdependent sectors,"Natural and man-caused disasters disrupt the production of commodities and services that are essential to the functions of infrastructure and economic sectors. The intrinsic interdependencies among these sectors trigger the propagation of disaster consequences that often result in a wider range of inoperability and amplified losses. This paper evaluates the impact of using inventory-enhanced policies on the recovery behavior among disrupted interdependent sectors. A dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM) is extended to identify the critical sectors based on two underlying minimization objectives, inoperability and economic loss. A dynamic cross prioritization plot (DCPP) is developed to integrate these objectives into a prioritization tool that allows variation in the importance associated with each objective. Implementing the methodology for the state of Virginia, a baseline inventory case revealed a high concentration of: (i) manufacturing sectors under the inoperability objective, and (ii) service sectors under the economic loss objective. Simulation of enhanced inventory policies to the manufacturing sectors reduced the recovery period by nearly a week and the total economic loss by $47.58M. The variation of importance attributed to the two objectives is demonstrated for the inventory-enhanced case. While the study focuses on enhancing inventory levels in Virginia's manufacturing sectors, complementary analysis is recommended to manage the resilience of the service sectors. The flexibility and scalability of the proposed prioritization methodology and the resulting decision support system can also be extended to accommodate analysis in other regions as well as other disaster scenarios. © 2011 IEEE."

Experience from the use of the interactive model-And gis-based information and decision support system LandCaRe-DSS for the development of economic effective application strategies of agriculture to climate change,"The expected change of climate will influence agriculture in a multifactorial manner. Up to now there are few suitable tools and methods for agricultural farms and other decision makers to give helpful answers on questions like: How will climate change influence regional agriculture and ecosystems and what will be possible adaptation strategies for agriculture. The newly developed information and decision support system, called LandCaRe-DSS, closes this gap. It is designed as a user friendly, interactive, model-based, and spatial-oriented information and decision support system, can be used on different spatial scales, and supports long-term and ensemble simulations on a high spatial resolution. The LandCaRe-DSS system assists strategic planning in agriculture and sustainable development of rural areas (regions) and provides answers concerning the effects and costs of possible adaptation measures. Being still a prototype, LandCaRe-DSS is parameterized and validated for two German regions at present. The impact models used in LandCaRe-DSS, the experience of collaboration with stakeholders, and the possibilities and limitations of the LandCare-DSS are described just like practical experience gathered during the system development from the modelling and implementation point of view. First results of scenario simulations based on different climate regionalization methods are presented and discussed."
Development of decision support system for optimal agricultural production under global environment changes,"In this study, a concept for a decision support system for optimal agricultural production under global environment changes is proposed. To sustain the productivity under climate change, is not sufficient in Japan The Japanese market and consumers are quality-sensitive and, considering benefits of farmers, they need to produce quality products. In this study, a new concept of a decision support system to realize such production is suggested by combining a crop mode that considers crop quality and water/soil models that supply dynamic soil and water conditions to the crop model. © 2011 SICE."
Decision-support system for urban air pollution under future climate conditions,"Climate change is expected to influence urban living conditions and challenge the ability of cities to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Urban climates will be faced with elevated temperatures and future climate conditions are expected to cause higher ozone concentrations, increased biogenic emissions from vegetation, changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere and changes in deposition of particulate air pollution. This paper describes a conceptual outline of a decision-support system for assessment of the impacts of climate change on urban climate and air quality, and for assessment of integrated climate change and air pollution adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing."
Agent-based modelling of socio-ecosystems: a methodology for the analysis of adaptation to climate change,"The integrated—environmental, economic and social—analysis of climate change calls for a paradigm shift as it is fundamentally a problem of complex, bottom-up and multi-agent human behaviour. There is a growing awareness that global environmental change dynamics and the related socio-economic implications involve a degree of complexity that requires an innovative modelling of combined social and ecological systems. Climate change policy can no longer be addressed separately from a broader context of adaptation and sustainability strategies. Past research on artificial intelligence and social simulation has developed a promising methodology. Literature on agent-based modelling (ABM) shows it’s potential to couple social and environmental models and incorporate the influence of micro-level decision making in the system dynamics and to study the emergence of collective responses to policies. However, there are few studies that concretely apply this methodology to the study of climate change related issues. The analysis in this paper supports the idea that today ABM is a consolidated interdisciplinary approach for the bottom-up exploration of climate policies, especially because it can take into account adaptive behaviour and heterogeneity of the system’s components."
Adaptation to Climate Change in Regional Australia: A Decision-Making Framework for Modelling Policy for Rural Production,"A decision-making framework was developed and applied in regional Australia to identify adaptation issues arising in agricultural systems and rural production as a consequence of climate change. Australian agriculture is very susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change, with major shifts in temperature and rainfall projected. An advantage of the framework is that it provides a suite of tools to aid in the formulation of strategies for sustainable regional development and adaptation. The decision-making framework uses a participatory approach that integrates land suitability analysis with uncertainty analysis and spatial optimisation to determine optimal agricultural land use (at a regional scale) for current and possible future climatic conditions. It thus provides a robust analytic approach to (i) recognise regions under threat of productivity declines, (ii) identify alternative cropping systems better adapted to likely future climatic conditions and (iii) investigate policy actions to improve the sub-optimal situations created by climate change. The decision-making framework and its methods were applied in a case study of the South West Region of Victoria."
Fuzzy logic based IEDSSs for environmental risk assessment and management,"Environmental problems and the related adaptation strategies have grown in importance and complexity during the last years. The large amount of data and information that needs to be handled and integrated requires specific methodologies and tools. Several research and application activities are undergoing worldwide for the development of Decision Support Systems (DSSs) that allow management of multiple and different data in order to aid decision-making. In this paper the following DSSs using fuzzy models based Artificial Intelligence to address environmental problems will be presented. SYRIADE is a Spatial DSS for Regional Risk Assessment of degraded land supporting the inventory and assessment of contaminated sites and mining waste sites at regional scale. DESYRE addresses the main phases of contaminated sites' remediation process, e.g. analysis of social and economic benefits and constraints, site characterization, risk assessment, selection of best available technologies, analysis of residual risk and comparison of different remediation scenarios. MODELKEY is a GIS-based DSS that supports the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation by allowing the environmental quality evaluation of fluvial ecosystems and the prioritization of hot spots along the river basin. Finally, the CMCC DSS supports the identification and prioritization of climate change impacts and risks on coastal zones, in order to guide the definition of appropriate adaptations strategies."
Risk assessment and decision support tools for the integrated evaluation of climate change impacts on coastal zones,"Nowadays there is new and stronger evidence that sea level rise, increased storminess and coastal erosion as a consequence of global warming are likely to have profound impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) is an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate and rank potential impacts, targets and areas at risk from climate change hazards. Within the Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC) a RRA methodology was developed to assess impacts of climate change at the regional scale and to assist coastal communities in planning adaptation measures. The proposed methodology integrates the output of downscaled climate, circulation, morphodynamic and biogeochemical models to represent the exposure to climate change hazards (e.g., flooding, erosion, water quality changes) and includes the analysis of site-specific environmental and socio-economic vulnerability of coastal systems to the impact of hazards (e.g., land use, geomorphology, vegetation cover, population density). It is implemented as part of a GIS-based DEcision support SYstem for COastal climate change impact assessment (DESYCO), that will provide information about downscaled climate change scenarios and regional/local vulnerabilities and risks, and will guide decision-makers in planning appropriate adaptation strategies. The main components of the DSS and of the RRA methodology and the preliminary results of their application to the coastal area of the Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy) are here presented and discussed."
Developing optimal hazard investment strategies,"There has been a significant increase in natural disasters that have negatively affected the U.S. economy in recent decades. The Government Accountability Office reported that the U.S. is not well prepared to manage large-scale natural disasters either through emergency response or financial relief. It is essential to develop integrated post-disaster investment strategies that avoid many of the pitfalls that have been observed following recent catastrophic events. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to build theoretical foundation and demonstrate technologies for creating a decision support system for optimizing stakeholders' resource allocation in natural hazards. The proposed framework will: (1) minimize the total costs associated with implementing such investment strategies and (2) maximize the uniformity of welfare distribution among all associated parties. This would provide broad members of the emergency management community as well as policy makers with easy-to-use preparedness and decision support tool, which would help in creating better societal financial resilience towards natural hazards.

Needs for climate information in support of decision-making in the water sector,"As the fundamental drivers of the hydrological cycle are affected by increasing climate variability and climate change, the need for climate information for effective decision making in the water sector is crucial. Water resources management is essentially bounded by how the extremes - floods and droughts - are defined and characterized, along with methods and standards for reducing the risks to society. The ways in which water managers can adapt to contemporary climate variability, and which ultimately will serve as the foundation to adapting to climate change are described. Water managers use various surveillance, monitoring and assessment systems. Numerous variations of Decision Support System (DSS) tools have been developed by the water sector to assist in policy formulation, design, planning and operation of water infrastructure and some examples are given. The socio-economic factors that affect decision making, the mechanisms for interacting with stakeholders and water governance are described. Adaptation to current climate variability and potential climate change is a prerequisite for sustainable development and poverty reduction and needs to be integrated into the broader water resources development and management processes. Potential adaptation strategies in the water sector are described with examples. The needs for tailored climate products and services for the water sector are described. The major gaps in observations of climate change related to freshwater and hydrological cycles and the requirements for research and technology as well as for infrastructure, education, training and capacity-building are highlighted. © 2010 Published by Elsevier."
Reviewing agent-based modelling of socio-ecosystems: a methodology for the analysis of climate change adaptation and sustainability,"The integrated - environmental, economic and social - analysis of climate change calls for a paradigm shift as it is fundamentally a problem of complex, bottom-up and multi-agent human behaviour. There is a growing awareness that global environmental change dynamics and the related socio-economic implications involve a degree of complexity that requires an innovative modelling of combined social and ecological systems.

However, there are few publications which concretely apply this methodology to the study of climate change related issues. The analysis of the state of the art reported in this paper supports the idea that today ABM is an appropriate methodology for the bottom-up exploration of climate policies, especially because it can take into account adaptive behaviour and heterogeneity of the system's components."
"Resilience, climate change, and security: Modeling the connections","The increasing range and complexity of global-scale problems call for both interdisciplinary approaches and ever-increasingly sophisticated modeling tools to use in analyzing issues and forecasting potential issues and their resolution. This study has focused on the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) as a developing region with essential roles in the global issues of climate change, terrorism/national security, and overall economic development and well-being. The research is integrating the domains of social conditions, technology, environment, climate change, food security, terrorism, and national security. In a new modeling space developed in STELLA®, researchers are drawing upon three existing models (MiniCAM, EPIC, and VRIM), adding governance and societal factors, and focusing on integrated issues such as the expansion of biofuels production. The working prototype draws on all of these models and knowledge domains to address issues relevant to analysts and policymakers re tradeoffs in food and fuel security in biofuel production.

"From management to negotiation: Technical and institutional innovations for integrated water resource management in the upper comoé river basin, burkina faso","This study focuses on the potential role of technical and institutional innovations for improving water management in a multi-user context in Burkina Faso. We focus on a system centered on three reservoirs that capture the waters of the Upper Comoé River Basin and servicing a diversity of users, including a sugar manufacturing company, a urban water supply utility, a farmer cooperative, and other downstream users. Due to variable and declining rainfall and expanding users' needs, drastic fluctuations in water supply and demand occur during each dry season. A decision support tool was developed through participatory research to enable users to assess the impact of alternative release and diversion schedules on deficits faced by each user. The tool is meant to be applied in the context of consultative planning by a local user committee that has been created by a new national integrated water management policy. We contend that both solid science and good governance are instrumental in realizing efficient and equitable water management and adaptation to climate variability and change. But, while modeling tools and negotiation platforms may assist users in managing climate risk, they also introduce additional uncertainties into the deliberative process. It is therefore imperative to understand how these technological and institutional innovations frame water use issues and decisions to ensure that such framing is consistent with the goals of integrated water resource management. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
Assessing vulnerability of selected farming communities in the Philippines based on a behavioural model of agent's adaptation to global environmental change,"Behavioural models that allow simple representation of the complexity of human–environment links are important in vulnerability assessment because they allow the analysis of human adaptive processes in a changing environment. This paper applies an agent-based framework that considers the behavioural model of farmers in three villages in a municipality in the Philippines. Agent-based modelling is a useful policy tool for simulating the effects of different adaptation options on reducing vulnerability because it allows representation of not only the dynamic changes in climate and market but also the dynamic adaptive process of different groups of communities to the impacts of these changes. Model simulations of adaptation options under various global change scenarios showed that production support would significantly reduce future vulnerability only if complemented with appropriate market support. It is thus important for policy to provide a complementary bundle of adaptation measures. Lack of money and information are the most important reasons for not applying available technical adaptation measures, which currently hinder reduction of vulnerability in selected villages in the municipality. Social networks, which play an important role in adapting to environmental changes, are limited to relatives and neighbours, who are important sources of informal credit."
Challenges of alpine catchment management under changing climatic and anthropogenic pressures,"Water resources in mountain areas are particularly important with respect to new and increasing pressures in the headwater areas of catchments. Climate change has resulted in a decrease in precipitation and decrease in groundwater recharge in the western and southern Alps over the last few decades. This is coupled with changing anthropogenic pressures such as an increase in water abstraction for tourism and artificial snow in addition to the water demands of agriculture and hydroelectricity. Water consumption by tourism in winter is several times higher than that of the permanent population. To avoid the development of water shortages with relation to other users, a clear quantification of parameters within the water cycle is necessary. However, measurements of classical hydrological and biological components for model validation are often missing and terrestrial photogrammetry is not yet purposefully applied. An integrated hydrological model is applied to the ski resort of Les Arcs, Bourg-St-Maurice in Savoy, France, taking into account the impacts of artificial snow on torrent discharge under different climatological and anthropogenic scenarios with relation to interbasin water transfer. The classical arguments for the expansion of artificial snow are the necessity of winter tourism to maintain the local and regional economy but no empirical relation exists between snow production and ski frequentation. If the clear trend of increasing temperatures in the mountains continues, less and less reliable snowmaking days will be available and some regions may gradually turn into unprofitable zones depending on wind (e.g. foehn conditions), evaporation, aspect and altitude. New adaptation strategies for diversification of tourism in mountain areas, e.g. through a four seasons approach, have to be developed. Since mountain areas are highly fragile, powerful decision support systems are required to control hydrological modifications and prevent water conflicts. Scientists cooperating with stakeholders will be increasingly confronted with issues such as economical benefits versus environmental impacts. Even before the stage of developing decision support tools with the stakeholders concerned, important work is necessary to develop an interdisciplinary and intersectorial problem consciousness and acceptance. There is an urgent need for sub-scale catchment management plans that take into account local hydrological and economical requirements and conflicts that are linked to, but not overshadowed by large-scale catchment plans."
Preparing for the aftermath: Using emotional agents in game-based training for disaster response,"Ground Truth, a training game developed by Sandia National Laboratories in partnership with the University of Southern California GamePipe Lab, puts a player in the role of an Incident Commander working with teammate agents to respond to urban threats. These agents simulate certain emotions that a responder may feel during this high-stress situation. We construct psychology-plausible models compliant with the Sandia Human Embodiment and Representation Cognitive Architecture (SHERCA) that are run on the Sandia Cognitive Runtime Engine with Active Memory (SCREAM) software. SCREAM's computational representations for modeling human decision-making combine aspects of ANNs and fuzzy logic networks. This paper gives an overview of Ground Truth and discusses the adaptation of the SHERCA and SCREAM into the game. We include a semiformal descriptionof SCREAM. ©2008 IEEE."
Participatory modeling in dairy farm systems: A method for building consensual environmental sustainability using seasonal climate forecasts,"Dairy farmers face increasing pressure to decrease environmental impact while remaining economically viable. Adaptation of farm management practices in response to seasonal climate forecasts may be one means of achieving these objectives. This paper describes the interactive and iterative process by which farmers, researchers, extension agents, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders collaborated to create, calibrate, and validate the Dynamic North Florida Dairy Farm model (DyNoFlo), a whole-farm decision support system to decrease nitrogen leaching while maintaining profitability under variable climate conditions. Participatory modeling may enhance the creation of adoptable and adaptable user-friendly models that include environmental, economic and biophysical components. By providing farmers, policy makers, and other stakeholders with a more holistic view of current practices, common ground among them was more easily identified and collaboration was fostered. Farmer values included willingness to be good environmental stewards when they are profitable. The participatory research and development process enhanced understanding of and potential adaptation to seasonal climate variability conditioned to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases in light of increasing environmental regulations and economic challenges. Adoption of the collaboratively-developed DyNoFlo is expected to be higher than usual because stakeholders feel greater ownership of the final product. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
Using portfolio theory to guide reforestation and restoration under climate change scenarios,"The general problem addressed by this study is that of designing a decision support system for planned adaptation to climate change that uses the principles of modern portfolio theory to minimise risk and maximise return of adaptive actions in an environment of deep uncertainty over future climate scenarios. Here we show how modern portfolio theory can use the results of a climate change impact model to select an optimal set of seed sources to be used in regenerating forests of white spruce in an environment of multiple, equally plausible future climates. This study shows that components of solutions are not selected to perform equally well across all plausible futures; but rather, that components are selected to specialise in particular climate scenarios. The innovation of this research rests in demonstrating that the powerful and widely used principles of quantifying and planning for risk and return in the uncertain environment of asset markets can be applied successfully to serve the objectives of planned adaptation to climate change. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
A decision support framework to assess supply chain resilience,"Our research is aimed at developing a quantitative approach for assessing supply chain resilience to disasters, a topic that has been discussed primarily in a qualitative manner in the literature. For this purpose, we propose a simulation-based framework that incorporates concepts of resilience into the process of supply chain design. In this context, resilience is defined as the ability of a supply chain system to reduce the probabilities of disruptions, to reduce the consequences of those disruptions, and to reduce the time to recover normal performance. The decision framework incorporates three determinants of supply chain resilience (density, complexity, and node criticality) and discusses their relationship to the occurrence of disruptions, to the impacts of those disruptions on the performance of a supply chain system and to the time needed for recovery. Different preliminary strategies for evaluating supply chain resilience to disasters are identified, and directions for future research are discussed."
AgClimate: Information and tools for decision making in agriculture,"AgClimate is a response to the need for information and tools on proactive adaptations to seasonal climate variability forecasts in the Southeastern US. Extension agents, agricultural producers, forest managers, crop consultants, and policy makers may use this decision support system to aid in decision making concerning management adjustments in light of climate forecasts. Adaptations include those that maximize yields as well as others that might mitigate potential losses. AgClimate is a web-based DSS that was designed and implemented in partnership with state Extension Services. It has two main components: the front end interface and a set of dynamic tools. The website was deployed in a Linux environment with specific applications and Perl modules installed. The dynamic tools were developed using the PHP web programming language interacting with FLASH movies and MySQL databases. The main navigation menu includes the AgClimate tools, forecasts, crops, forestry, pasture, livestock, and a climate and El Niño section with background information. The AgClimate tools section contains two applications or tools that allow a user to exam the climate forecast for his/her county based on the ENSO phase and to evaluate yield potentials for peanut, tomato and potato in a limited number of counties."
